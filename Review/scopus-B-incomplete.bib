abstract={Managing supply chain activities have become a critical issue for manufacturing organization due to globalization and challenges faced by sustainability. Performance of supply chain can be evaluated by indicators and other factors. The evaluation of these factors becomes difficult due to lack of benchmarks and evaluation method. The supply chain has wide range of opportunities in the Industry 4.0 which is driven by many key enabling technologies such as: artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and blockchain technology. These technologies have a positive impact on the sustainability performance of the supply chain activities. The decision-making models plays an important role in the evaluation of the supply chain strategies. The present study aims to identify and report the different models used in the sustainable supply chain management. These models are multi-criteria decision-making models, multi-objective-based models, artificial intelligence-based models. Bibliometric analysis is done with the VOSviewer and R studio using the bibliographic data of digital scientific databases. The content analysis is done after the bibliometric analysis based on the cluster analysis done in R studio. The main research areas and future research directions have been reported in the end of study. It is expected that this study can be helpful for the practitioners, policymakers and academia working in the area of sustainable supply chain management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Considering customer reviews is one of the challenges of real-world decision models. These reviews can be on different platforms and include a large amount of information and may also include incomprehensible and unrelated phrases. The main advantage of customer reviews is the realistic view that it provides a realistic view of the product or service. Therefore, converting unstructured and incoherent customer-based reviews into machine learning language and ultimately turning it into a decision model is very important. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end ranking method for integrating mechanisms such as text processing, sentiment analysis and the multi-criteria decision-making technique. The proposed ranking method relies on the integration of three methods, namely, the aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) method, the Dawid-Skene algorithm and the Best Worst Method (BWM). In other words, the proposed work encompasses four major steps: i) crawling customer reviews, ii) preprocessing, iii) aspect term extraction, aspect category detection and polarity detection, and iv) designing a decision-making model. The main contribution of this study is to consider ABSA at three levels simultaneously and integrate ABSA and BWM in designing an end-to-end ranking method for ranking the quality of hotel services, facilities and amenities based on customer reviews. The ability of the proposed end-to-end ranking framework is evaluated using a real data set of user reviews of Sydney hotels. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The fasting blood glucose (FBG) values extracted from electronic medical records (EMR) are assumed valid in existing research, which may cause diagnostic bias due to misclassification of fasting status. We proposed a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict the fasting status of blood samples. This cross-sectional study was conducted using the EMR of a medical center from 2003 to 2018 and a total of 2,196,833 ontological FBGs from the outpatient service were enrolled. The theoretical true fasting status are identified by comparing the values of ontological FBG with average glucose levels derived from concomitant tested HbA1c based on multi-criteria. In addition to multiple logistic regression, we extracted 67 features to predict the fasting status by eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The discrimination and calibration of the prediction models were also assessed. Real-world performance was gauged by the prevalence of ineffective glucose measurement (IGM). Of the 784,340 ontologically labeled fasting samples, 77.1% were considered theoretical FBGs. The median (IQR) glucose and HbA1c level of ontological and theoretical fasting samples in patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) were 94.0 (87.0, 102.0) mg/dL and 5.6 (5.4, 5.9)%, and 92.0 (86.0, 99.0) mg/dL and 5.6 (5.4, 5.9)%, respectively. The XGBoost showed comparable calibration and AUROC of 0.887 than that of 0.868 in multiple logistic regression in the parsimonious approach and identified important predictors of glucose level, home-to-hospital distance, age, and concomitantly serum creatinine and lipid testing. The prevalence of IGM dropped from 27.8% based on ontological FBGs to 0.48% by using algorithm-verified FBGs. The proposed ML algorithm or multiple logistic regression model aids in verification of the fasting status. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The Choquet integral has been used as an aggregation operator to deal with interacting criteria in different types of problems. For ordinal classification problems, the majority of Choquet integral-based models proposed in the literature are built upon a supervised machine learning perspective, where a training data set is considered. Despite the effectiveness of these classification algorithms, their training-data-dependency may be considered a drawback in some decision-making problems. Our goal is then to propose a new multiple criteria Choquet classifier to conduct sorting based on user preference information. The classifier is built inside the FlowSort framework and, as such, aggregates intensity of preferences with respect to pairs of criteria instead of directly aggregating the criteria evaluations. This characteristic allows criteria and limiting profiles to be assessed by heterogeneous scales. In addition, we apply the Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis to the proposed classifier in order to elicit the Choquet capacities, model uncertain input data and analyze robustness of the results. The proposed classifier is applied to a real decision problem regarding the evaluation of pharmaceutical suppliers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Radiomics can be used to quantify image heterogeneity. Whether radiomics can be used to screen out features such as fingerprint from MRI images of osteoporotic vertebral bodies to predict the occurrence of new fracture is worth studying. OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of constructing a machine learning prediction model for thoracolumbar refracture after vertebral augmentation through combining MRI radiomics features and clinical information. METHODS: This study retrospectively collected the data of patients who were diagnosed with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture by MRI and treated with percutaneous vertebral augmentation in Chengdu First People’s Hospital from May 2014 to April 2019. PyRadiomics was used to extract the imaging features of T1 sequences of vertebral MRI at the T11-L2 segments before percutaneous vertebral augmentation. All models were constructed in the training set, and prediction performance evaluation was performed in the validation set. Feature dimension reduction was conducted by applying least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. The corresponding refracture prediction models were constructed by multivariate logistic regression, random forest and adaptive lifting algorithm analysis using clinical parameters, selected features or the integrating of both. The diagnostic efficacy of the model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve. The decision analysis curve was used to compare the clinical value of each model. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) A total of 336 vertebrae were included in 135 patients, of which 67 vertebrae had refractures. 1 746 features were extracted from each vertebra, and 13 important features were obtained through dimension reduction. (2) Among the three models, area under curve of the combined model in the training set and validation set was significantly higher than that of the clinical model (P < 0.05), and the decision analysis curve also showed that the net benefit of the combined model in predicting thoracolumbar refracture was higher than that of the clinical model in most threshold intervals. (3) The results indicated that it was feasible to construct a refracture prediction model based on MRI T1 sequence imaging and clinical information, which could help to identify the vertebrae with high risk of refracture at early stage. © 2022, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

abstract={Museums are of special nature because of their dynamic environment and different audiences. These unique characteristics make evacuation process in cases of fire incidents and similar threats difficult to assess or predict. That is due to the interaction between artifacts and museum visitors who might be from different backgrounds. The visits themselves could also be dynamic, multivariable with sensitive experience. This paper presents an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) framework that simulates the visitation and evacuation inside museums. The proposed framework enhances visitation management and assesses evacuation efficiency in museums during fire incidents or threats. Human characteristics of occupants such as age, gender, physical ability and familiarity to the surroundings are considered in the proposed ABS. The proposed framework analyses the proximity among occupants during visitations and simulates the decision-making process during evacuation. A meta-heuristic supervised machine learning approach is used by deploying fuzzy classification method to determine the relative weights of criteria that might affect the performance of visitation and evacuation. A case study for Tutankhamun gallery in the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) is used to illustrate the practicality of the proposed model. The results from the case study shows that an average of 18 min is required for safe evacuation including pre-evacuation time. To examine the robustness of the proposed framework, sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the factors that the model is most sensitive to. The number of exists and the certainty of diagnosis from occupants of the surrounding events are the factors that the model is highly sensitive to. The proposed framework can identify personal characteristics of occupants in the simulation environment, as well as social psychological dimensions that have an effect on decision-making while evacuating. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To accelerate data-driven studies for various optimization applications in chemical engineering, a comprehensive machine learning aided multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision making (abbreviated as ML aided MOO-MCDM) framework is proposed in the present paper. The framework comprises a total of seven steps; firstly, study the application and its input-output datasets to identify objectives, constraints and required ML models; secondly, select ML model(s) for some or all objectives and constraints; thirdly, train the chosen ML model(s), including finding optimal hyperparameter values in each of them using an advanced/global optimization algorithm; fourthly, formulate the MOO problem for the application; fifthly, select a MOO method and develop/test the program; sixthly, solve the formulated MOO problem with the developed/tested MOO program many times and review the Pareto-optimal solutions obtained; lastly, perform MCDM using several methods and choose one Pareto-optimal solution for implementation. The proposed ML aided MOO-MCDM framework is useful for process design and operation of chemical and related processes. It is shown to be beneficial for the optimization of two complex chemical processes, which are supercritical water gasification process aiming for H2-rich syngas with lower greenhouse gas emissions, and combustion process in a power plant targeting for higher energy output and lower pollution of the environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms have been widely employed for solving optimization problems. Their ability to find optimal solutions depends heavily on the parameterization of the pheromone trails. However, the pheromone parameterization mechanisms in existing ACO algorithms have two major shortcomings: 1) pheromone trails are instance-specific; hence they need to be generated for each new problem instance, 2) solution is constructed based on static pheromone trails, which ignores the impact of the evolving decisions on the final solution. In this paper, we study the personalized journey route planning problem on multimodal public transport networks (MMPTN) that considers multiple travel criteria. The problem is addressed with a weighted sum method, which provides a journey route that best matches passenger's preference vector consisting of multiple travel criteria. We propose a Machine Learning (ML) based Max–Min Ant System (called ML-MMAS) to solve optimization problems by incorporating ML techniques into Ant Colony Optimization algorithms. ML-MMAS learns a pheromone function to directly produce prominent pheromone trails in order to construct solutions for any new instance, without the need to initialize and update the pheromone trails from scratch. We propose a self-learning framework to train the ML-MMAS using incremental solutions generated by MMAS, hence avoiding the need for pre-computed optimal solutions. Specifically, we develop a deep learning-based pheromone prediction model. We design several groups of features to train the model to characterize the evolving states of the search space during solution construction. Finally, we propose a solution component embedding (SCE) model to learn representations of solution components (transit services), which takes into account the transferability among transit services and passenger transfer preferences. The SCE model enables the extraction of high-quality features for the solution components. It can also be directly applied to solve other optimization problems with solutions that can be modeled as sequences of solution components. We evaluate the proposed ML-MMAS by comparing with exact algorithms and the underlying MMAS, using the MMPTN and passenger demands of Singapore. Results show that ML-MMAS is significantly faster than both the exact algorithm and the original MMAS, while achieving near-optimal solutions. © 2022},

abstract={The digital twin (DT) is a virtual replica of real-world buildings, processes, structures, people, and systems created and maintained to answer questions about its physical part, the physical twin (PT). In the case of the built environment, the PT is represented by smart buildings and infrastructures. Full synchronization between the DT and the PT will allow for a perpetual learning process and updating between the two twins. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of DT called risk-informed digital twin (RDT). In the DT the model predictions are developed through data-driven tools and algorithms. However, multiple sources of uncertainty during the lifecycle challenge our understanding and ability to effectively model the performance of the modeled systems. The RDT's importance lies in its integration of the methods and tools of statistics and risk analysis with machine learning. To this aim, the platform incorporates a novel framework of data-driven uncertainty quantification and risk analysis rooted in information theory. At the core of the RDT is a framework of sustainable and resilient based engineering (SRBE), introduced in this work and considered the first step toward the extension of performance-based engineering (PBE) approaches to socioecological-technical systems under uncertainty. A risk-informed multicriteria decision support tool able to incorporate social aspects is also included, and it can be used for sustainable and resilient design in the early stage, or management under uncertainty of smart buildings and infrastructure systems. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Extracting domain knowledge is important for different purposes, including development of new systems and maintenance of existing systems in the domain. Automatically supporting this task is challenging; most existing methods assume high similarity of variants which limits reuse of the generated domain artifacts, or provide very low-level features which hinder domain structure and behavior. In this paper, we propose a holistic method for extracting domain knowledge in the form of feature models that capture mandatory, optional and variant domain behaviors. Particularly, the method gets low-level implementations, applies polymorphism-inspired mechanisms and multi-criteria decision making for generating candidate domain behaviors, utilizes machine learning techniques to classify local, global and irrelevant domain behaviors, and finally analyzes dependencies and presents the outcomes in the form of feature models. The approach is evaluated on two datasets: one of open-source video games, named apo-games, following a clone-and-own scenario; and the other on variants of a monopoly game, simulating a scenario of independent development of similarly behaving components. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The increasing environmental problems due to various organic micropollutants in water cause the search of suitable additional water treatment methods. Gaining experimental data for the large amount and variety of pollutants would consume a lot of time as well as economic and ecologic resources. An alternative approach is predictive quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling, which establishes a correlation between the structural properties of a molecules with a biological, physical, or chemical property. Therefore, in this study, QSPR modeling has been conducted using extensive validation techniques and statistical test to investigate the structural influence on the degradability of organic micropollutants with ozonation. In contrast to most of the other studies, the underlying dataset - rate constants for 92 organic molecules - were obtained under standardized conditions with defined experimental parameters. QSPR modeling was executed using a combination of the software PaDEL for descriptor calculation and QSARINS for the modeling process respecting all five OECD-requirements for applicable QSAR/QSPR-models. The final model was selected using a multi-criteria decision-making tool to evaluate the model quality based on all calculated statistical quality parameters. The model included 10 selected descriptors and fingerprints and showed good regression abilities, predictive power, and stability (R² = 0.8221, CCCtr = 0.9024, Q²loo = 0.7436, R²ext = 0.8420, Q²F1 = 0.8104). The applicability domain of the QSPR model was defined and an interpretation of selected model descriptors has been connected to previous experimental studies. A significant influence of the interpretable descriptors was put into experimental context and compared with previous studies and models. For example, the molar refractivity as a measure of size and polarizability of a molecule and the occurrence of important substructures such as a formamide group seem to decrease the removal rate constant. The contribution of lone electrons entering into resonance as well as the occurrence of fused rings were identified as influences for the increase of the degradability of micropollutants by ozonation. © 2022 The Author(s)},

The current research provides a novel framework through machine learning techniques to propose course recommendations in MOOCs according to the uses’ preferences and behavior. The method is developed using multi-criteria ratings extracted from users’ online reviews. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for text mining, Decision Trees for decision rule generation, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for users’ reviews on courses and the fuzzy rule-based system for users’ preferences prediction. We also adopt a feature selection method to select the most important criteria for users’ preferences prediction. The method is evaluated using the data collected from an online learning platform, Udemy.

abstract={Detecting serial crimes is to find criminals who have committed multiple crimes. A classification technique is often used to process serial crime detection, but the pairwise comparison of crimes is of quadratic complexity, and the number of nonserial case pairs far exceeds the number of serial case pairs. The blocking method can play a role in reducing pairwise calculation and eliminating nonserial case pairs. But the limitation of previous studies is that most of them use a single criterion to select blocks, which is difficult to guarantee an excellent blocking result. Some studies integrate multiple criteria into one comprehensive index. However, the performance is easily affected by the weighting method. In this paper, we propose a combined blocking (CB) approach. Each criminal behaviour is defined as a behaviour key (BHK) and used to form a block. CB learns several weak blocking schemes by different blocking criteria and then combines them to form the final blocking scheme. The final blocking scheme consists of several BHKs. Because rare behaviour can better identify crime series, each BHK is assigned a score according to its rarity. BHKs and their scores are used to determine whether a case pair need to be compared. After comparing with multiple blocking methods, CB can effectively guarantee the number of serial case pairs while greatly reducing unnecessary nonserial case pairs. The CB is embedded in a supervised machine learning framework. Experiments on real-world robbery cases demonstrate that it can effectively reduce pairwise comparison, alleviate the class imbalance problem and improve detection performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this paper, one multidisciplinary-applicable aggregated model has been proposed and verified. This model uses traditional techniques, on the one hand, and algorithms of machine learning as modern techniques, on the other hand, throughout the determination process of the relevance of model attributes for solving any problems of multicriteria decision. The main goal of this model is to take advantage of both approaches and lead to better results than when the techniques are used alone. In addition, the proposed model uses feature selection methodology to reduce the number of attributes, thus increasing the accuracy of the model. We have used the traditional method of regression analysis combined with the well-known mathematical method Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). This approach has been combined with the application of the ReliefF classificatory modern ranking method of machine learning. Last but not least, the decision tree classifier J48 has been used for aggregation purposes.

abstract={The use of software and IoT services is increasing significantly among people with special needs, who constitute 15% of the world’s population. However, selecting appropriate services to create a composite assistive service based on the evolving needs and context of disabled user groups remains a challenging research endeavor. Our research applies a scenario‐based design technique to contribute (1) an inclusive disability ontology for assistive service selection, (2) semi‐synthetic generated disability service datasets, and (3) a machine learning (ML) framework to choose services adaptively to suit the dynamic requirements of people with special needs. The ML‐based selection framework is applied in two complementary phases. In the first phase, all available atomic tasks are assessed to determine their appropriateness to the user goal and profiles, whereas in the subsequent phase, the list of service providers is narrowed by matching their quality‐of‐service factors against the context and characteristics of the disabled person. Our methodology is centered around a myriad of user characteristics, including their disability profile, preferences, environment, and available IT resources. To this end, we extended the widely used QWS V2.0 and WS‐DREAM web services datasets with a fusion of selected accessibility features. To ascertain the validity of our approach, we compared its performance against common multi‐criteria decision making (MCDM) models, namely AHP, SAW, PROMETHEE, and TOPSIS. The findings demonstrate superior service selection accuracy in contrast to the other methods while ensuring accessibility requirements are satisfied. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The reliable estimation of displacement amplitude is the prime factor for the design of geo-structures supporting the vibration loads. Currently, very subtle knowledge is available to compute the displacement amplitude of footing resting on the geocell-reinforced bed subjected to vibration loading. The advent of artificial intelligence modelling has antiquated many traditional approaches. Thus, in the present study, a novel hybrid paradigm has been developed by combining the artificial neural network (ANN) with dragonfly optimizer (DFO), abbreviated as ANN-DFO. To train and test the model, the reliable database was developed by conducting extensive field vibration tests. To establish the specific prediction target for the proposed model, displacement amplitude (da) was considered as an output index. A combination of parameters involving properties of foundation bed, geocell reinforcement, and dynamic excitation has been considered as input variables. Along with the standalone ANN model, the predictive veracity of the ANN-DFO was also compared with three other robust machine learning models, namely, Gaussian process regression (GPR), random forest (RF), and M−5 rules. Primarily, the forecasting ability of the developed models was assessed based on rigorous statistical criteria and a multi-criteria approach. Moreover, the model is also validated against the entirely new independent data which is not part of the original dataset. From the results, ANN-DFO model has shown a superior performance in predicting the displacement amplitude of footing resting on geocell-reinforced beds as compared to the other benchmark models. Finally, the strength of input variables on the estimation of displacement amplitude was highlighted using the sensitivity analysis. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A Decision Support System (DSS) is a highly efficient concept for managing complex objects in nature or human-made phenomena. The main purpose of the present study is related to designing and implementation of real-time monitoring, prediction, and control system for flood disaster management as a DSS. Likewise, the problem of statement in the research is correlated to implementation of a system for different climates of Iran as a unique flood control system. For the first time, this study coupled hydrological data mining, Machine Learning (ML), and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) as smart alarm and prevention systems. Likewise, it created the platform for conditional management of floods in Iran's different clusters of climates. According to the KMeans clustering system, which determines homogeneity of the hydrology of a specific region, Iran's rainfall is heterogeneous with 0.61 score, which is approved high efficiency of clustering in a vast country such as Iran with four seasons and different climates. In contrast, the relation of rainfall and flood disaster is evaluated by Nearest Neighbors Classification (NNC), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC), and Neural Network (NN) algorithms which have an acceptable correlation coefficient with a mean of 0.7. The machine learning outputs demonstrated that based on valid data existence problems in developing countries, just with verified precipitation records, the flood disaster can be estimated with high efficiency. In the following, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method as a Game Theory (GT) technique ranked the preventive flood damages strategies through three social (Se 1), environmental (Se 2), and economic (Se 3) crises scenarios. The solutions of flood disaster management are collected from literature review, and the opinion approves them of 9 senior experts who are retired from a high level of water resource management positions of Iran. The outcomes of the TOPSIS method proved that National announcement for public-institutional participation for rapid response and funding (G1-2), Establishment of delay structures to increase flood focus time to give the animals in the ecosystem the opportunity to escape to the upstream points and to preserve the habitat (G 2–8), and Granting free national financial resources by government agencies in order to rebuild sensitive infrastructure such as railways, hospitals, schools, etc. to the provincial treasury (G3-10) are selected as the best solution of flood management in Social, Environmental, and Economic crises, respectively. Finally, the collected data are categorized in Social, Environmental, and Economic aspects as three dimensions of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ranked based on the opinion of 32 experts in the five provinces of present case studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Assessing the energy performance of existing residential buildings (ERB) has been identi-fied as key to improving building energy efficiency and reducing associated greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. However, identifying optimal retrofit packages requires a significant amount of knowledge of building energy modelling, and it is a time‐consuming and laborious process. This paper proposed a data‐driven framework that combines machine learning, multi‐objective optimi-zation, and multi‐criteria decision‐making techniques to evaluate the energy performance of ERB and thereby formulate optimal retrofit plans. First, an artificial neural network (ANN) was devel-oped to predict the energy performance of a wide range of retrofit packages. A genetic algorithm was employed to determine the best structure and hyperparameters of the ANN model. Then, the energy consumption results were integrated with environmental and economic impact data to evaluate the environmental and economic performance of retrofit packages and thereby identify Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, a multi‐criteria decision‐making method was used to select the best retrofit packages among the optimal solutions. The proposed framework was validated using data on a typical residential building in British Columbia, Canada. The results indicated that this framework could effectively predict building energy performance and help decision‐makers to make an optimal decision when choosing retrofit packages. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={On average, breast cancer kills one woman per minute. However, there are more reasons for optimism than ever before. When diagnosed early, patients with breast cancer have a better chance of survival. This study aims to employ a novel approach that combines artificial intelligence and a multi-criteria decision-making method for a more robust evaluation of machine learning models. The proposed machine learning techniques comprise various supervised learning algorithms, while the multi-criteria decision-making technique implemented includes the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations. The Support Vector Machine, having achieved a net outranking flow of 0.1022, is ranked as the most favorable model for the early detection of breast cancer. The net outranking flow is the balance between the positive and negative outranking flows. This indicates that the higher the net flow, the better the alternative. K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and random forest classifier ranked second, third, and fourth, with net flows of 0.0316, −0.0032, and −0.0541, respectively. The least preferred alternative is the naive Bayes classifier with a net flow of −0.0766. The results obtained in this study indicate the use of the proposed method in making a desirable decision when selecting the most appropriate machine learning model. This gives the decision-maker the option of introducing new criteria into the decision-making process. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The present study was done in order to simulate the flash-flood susceptibility across the Suha river basin in Romania using a number of 3 hybrid models and fuzzy-AHP multicriteria decision-making analysis. It should be noted that flash-flood events are triggered by heavy rainfall in small river catchments. To achieve the proposed results, a total of 8 flash-flood predictors (slope angle, plan curvature, hydrological soil groups, land use, convergence index, profile curvature, topographic position index, aspect) along with a sample of 111 torrential phenomena points were used as input datasets in the next four algorithms: Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), Deep Learning Neural Network -Analytical Hierarchy Process (DLNN-AHP), Multilayer Perceptron - Analytical Hierarchy Process (MLP-AHP) and Naïve Bayes - Analytical Hierarchy Process (NB-AHP). The Analytical Hierarchy Process was used to calculate the coefficients for each class/category of flash-flood predictors. The torrential points sample was split into training (70%) and validating samples (30%). The modelling was done in Excel, SPSS and R software (H2O package), while the result mapping was performed in ArcGIS 10.5 software. The analysis revealed that the high and very high susceptibility degrees are spread over a maximum of 35.01% of the study area. The best performances, demonstrated by an AUC-ROC of 0.984, are associated with the Deep Learning Neural Network – Analytical Hierarchy Process model, followed by Naïve Bayes – Analytical Hierarchy Process model (AUC = 0.976), Multilayer Perceptron - Analytical Hierarchy Process model (AUC = 0.882) and Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (AUC = 0.807). These results indicates that Deep Learning Neural Network is a promising machine learning model which can provide outcomes with very high precision. Also, according to the present research results the deep learning neural network, having many hidden layers, is able outperform the multilayer perceptron that contains a single hidden layer. The main novelty of the present research is the application of the three ensemble models (DLNN-AHP, MLP-AHP and NB-AHP) and also the use of H2O package for the first time in literature, to evaluate the flash-flood susceptibility in small river catchments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This research aims to analyze the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for classifying COVID-19 from cough sounds and to identify the model(s) that consistently perform well across different cough datasets. Different performance evaluation metrics (precision, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, accuracy, etc.) make selecting the best performance model difficult. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an ensemble-based multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method for selecting top performance machine learning technique(s) for COVID-19 cough classification. We use four cough datasets, namely Cambridge, Coswara, Virufy, and NoCoCoDa to verify the proposed method. At first, our proposed method uses the audio features of cough samples and then applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify them as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. Then, we consider a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that combines ensemble technologies (i.e., soft and hard) to select the best model. In MCDM, we use the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for ranking purposes, while entropy is applied to calculate evaluation criteria weights. In addition, we apply the feature reduction process through recursive feature elimination with cross-validation under different estimators. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. We see that when the proposed method is used for analysis using the Extra-Trees classifier, it has achieved promising results (AUC: 0.95, Precision: 1, Recall: 0.97). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Healthcare is considered one basic necessity to sustaining life; thereby, assessing the character of a healthy and resilient supply chain can help a nation develop ideas to combat the healthcare crisis. COVID-19 has led to a long-term strain on the healthcare supply chain (HCSC) and has resulted in a lack of basic healthcare necessities. It has become apparent that supply chain disruptions and increased usage has led to a lack of medical supplies needed to provide the proper care to patients. Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) will help to indicate what characteristics contribute to resilient healthcare supply chains. To assess the characteristic of a resilient supply chain, significant healthcare supply chains will help indicate significant characteristics. A case study on the medical supplies’ supply chains is presented. A rank reversal proximity index MCDM method ranks criteria to assist with decision making. The proximity index will reduce the chances of the rank reversal phenomenon that results in incorrect rankings from occurring. Results show that redundancy, collaboration, and robustness are key indicators of a resilient supply chain while, supply chain design, communication capabilities, and supply chain risk management become comparatively less important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, an unsupervised machine learning tecnique named “cluster analysis” is conducted to group the resilience indicators of the respective supply chain. Through this study, the best way to combat disruptions in the healthcare supply chain due to large-scale pandemics is to share information quickly, reduce reliance on the design of the supply chain, and track the usage of necessary medical supplies. Alternatively, we validated our study by comparing a Preference Selection Index (PSI) to the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The traditional surrounding rock classification method is mainly based on the drill and blast method, which is not suitable for evaluating and predicting the TBM tunneling performance. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish a rock mass boreability classification method suitable for TBM construction and achieve accurate perception and recognition of the boreability grade. For this purpose, based on the rock mass and TBM machine data sourced from four tunnels, the correlations between the rock mass parameters and TBM boreability evaluation indices were analyzed, and the multi-criteria decision-making(MCDM) method TOPSIS was used to establish the rock boreability classification system for TBM tunnel. Since it was difficult to obtain the parameters of rock mass in actual TBM excavation directly, the proposed rock mass boreability grade was recognized by using TBM driving parameters, including the thrust force per cutter(Th), penetration rate(PR), cutter head revolutions per minutes(RPM) and penetration rate per revolution(PRev). In the perception and recognition, Bayesian optimization was used to determine the optimal combination of input parameters of various machine learning classification algorithms to achieve the maximum accuracy of grade recognition. The applicability of different optimized algorithms for the boreability grade recognition was compared, and then the optimal perception and recognition method was determined. Finally, based on the real-time TBM data of Jilin Yinsong tunnel project, the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed classification, as well as the perception and recognition method of rock mass boreability were verified. The research results can be used to predict the boreability of rock mass in the stable operation sections of TBM projects, and provide reference for the optimization of TBM driving parameters and the establishment of intelligent control system. © 2022, Science Press.

abstract={Asynchronous Video Interviewing (AVI) is considered one of the most recent and promising innovations in the recruitment process. Using AVI in combination with AI-based technologies enables recruiters/employers to automate many of the tasks that are typically required for screening, assessing, and selecting candidates. In fact, the automated assessment and selection process is a complex and uncertain problem involving highly subjective, multiple interrelated criteria. In order to address these issues, an effective and practical approach is proposed that is able to transform, weight, combine, and rank automated AVI assessments obtained through AI technologies and machine learning. The suggested approach combines Cumulative Belief Structures with the Weighted Bonferroni-OWA operator, which allows (i) aggregating assessment scores obtained in different forms and scales; (ii) incorporating interrelationships between criteria into the analysis (iii) considering accuracies of the learning algorithms as weights of criteria; and (iv) weighting criteria objectively. The proposed approach ensures a completely data-driven and efficient approach to the personnel selection process. To justify the effectiveness and applicability of the suggested approach, an example case is presented in which the new approach is compared to classical MCDM techniques. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Due to the overall widespread accessibility of electronic materials available on the internet, the availability and usage of computers in education have resulted in a growth in the incidence of plagiarism among students. A growing number of individuals at colleges around the globe appear to be presenting plagiarised papers to their professors for credit, while no specific details are collected of how much was plagiarised previously or how much is plagiarised currently. Supervisors, who are overburdened with huge responsibility, desire a simple way—similar to a litmus test—to rapidly re-form plagiarized papers so that they may focus their work on the remaining students. Plagiarism-checking software programs are useful for detecting plagiarism in examinations, projects, publica-tions, and academic research. A number of the latest research findings dedicated to evaluating and comparing plagiarism-checking methods have demonstrated that these have restrictions in identifying the complicated structures of plagiarism, such as extensive paraphrasing as well as the utilization of technical manipulations, such as substituting original text with similar text from foreign alphanumeric characters. Selecting the best reliable and efficient plagiarism-detection method is a challenging task with so many options available nowadays. This paper evaluates the different academic plagiarism-detection methods using the fuzzy MCDM (multi-criteria decision-making) method and provides recommendations for the development of efficient plagiarism-detection systems. A hierarchy of evaluation is discussed, as well as an examination of the most promising plagiarism-detection methods that have the opportunity to resolve the constraints of current state-of-the-art tools. As a result, the study serves as a “blueprint” for constructing the next generation of plagiarism-checking tools. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Agroforestry in the form of intercropping, boundary plantation, and home garden are parts of traditional land management systems in India. Systematic implementation of agroforestry may help achieve various ecosystem benefits, such as reducing soil erosion, maintaining biodiversity and microclimates, mitigating climate change, and providing food fodder and livelihood. The current study collected ground data for agroforestry patches in the Belpada block, Bolangir district, Odisha state, India. The agroforestry site-suitability analysis employed 15 variables on climate, soil, topography, and proximity, wherein the land use land cover (LULC) map was referred to prescribe the appropriate interventions. The random forest (RF) machine learning model was applied to estimate the relative weight of the determinant variables. The results indicated high accuracy (average suitability >0.87 as indicated by the validation data) and highlighted the dominant influence of the socioeconomic variables compared to soil and climate variables. The results show that >90% of the agricultural land in the study area is suitable for various agroforestry interventions, such as bund plantation and intercropping, based on the cropping intensity. The settlement and wastelands were found to be ideal for home gardens and bamboo block plantations, respectively. The spatially explicit data on agroforestry suitability may provide a baseline map and help the managers and planners. Moreover, the adopted approach can be hosted in cloud-based platforms and applied in the different agro-ecological zones of India, employing the local ground data on various agroforestry interventions. The regional and national scale agroforestry suitability and appropriate interventions map would help the agriculture managers to implement and develop policies. © 2022 by the authors.

Moreover, we create landslide inventory maps from LANDSAT-8 satellite images through the change vector analysis (CVA) change detection method. The change detection yields more than 500 landslide spots. After some manual post-processing correction, the landslide inventory spots are randomly split into two sets with a 70/30 ratio for training and validating the performance of the ML techniques. Sixteen topographical, hydrological, and geological landslide-related factors of the study area are prepared as GIS layers. They are used to produce landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) with weighted overlay techniques using different weights of landslide-related factors. The accuracy assessment shows that the ML techniques outperform the MCDM methods, while SVM yields the highest accuracy of 88% for the resulting LSM. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Similarity measure (SM) formulas are very useful tool for Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, machine learning, medical diagnosis, psychology, etc. In this paper, some SM methods are introduced under single-valued type-2 neutrosophic (SVT2N) information, based on the Dice and Jaccard vector measures. Also, Cosine and weighted Cosine SMs between two SVT2N sets are defined for SVT2NSs. Then, motivated by the idea of vector measures, Hybrid SM and weighted Hybrid SM are developed by combining Dice and Cosine SMs. After then, a decision-making method is put forward based on technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Immediately after, a real example is given to indicate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed measures. In here, Hybrid SMs are discussed for different values of λ and compared with the Hybrid SMs and weighted Hybrid SMs in their own. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is made based on the TOPSIS among the vector measures, distance measures and Hybrid SMs and the agreement between the results with other measures shows that the Hybrid SM is strong and essential to minimize error margin for decision makers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

This study proposes a machine learning-based model for location selection that focuses on the estimation of sales potential of a prospective site and helps to overcome the lack of historical data for the prospective site and the subjective criteria used in conventional models. The proposed model involves three major steps. First, we use an attribute selection algorithm to identify the key factors that contribute to the profitability of a specific location. Second, we evaluate the similarity between the candidate site and the existing stores by using an improved grey comprehensive evaluation method. Finally, we use a kernel regression model to predict the sales potential of the candidate site. A case study of a well-known international restaurant chain is used to illustrate the application of the proposed data-driven model. The results indicate that our proposed model helps to accurately select the most profitable locations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Web services are globally utilized by clients to accomplish the required functionality over the web. As a result of its popularity and flexibility in usage, thousands of functionally similar web services are available over the network. Hence, it becomes necessary to select the optimal web service to satisfy the clients' need. Various methodologies like machine learning, genetic algorithm, bio-inspired techniques, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and many others aid in the process of selecting the best web service from thousands of alternatives. This paper aims in proposing a relatively new MCDM approach to solve the selection issue and thereby proposes a novel framework incorporating the proposed MCDM method to aid in the process of service selection. Reference ideal method (RIM) is a state-of-the-art MCDM technique to select the optimal web service based on user inputs. In spite of its popularity, this method is found to have multiple pitfalls which make the selection process less effective. This paper proposes a novel MCDM methodology named improved RIM (I-RIM) to overcome the existing pitfalls in RIM. The paper also proposes a novel framework which combines the power of graphics processing unit (GPU) and I-RIM to enhance the efficiency of the selection process. The proposed I-RIM when parallelized using GPU is found to outperform the parallelized MCDM techniques taken for study. The results also imply that the I-RIM is more consistent and stable towards the ranking process. It is also evident that the proposed framework which incorporates I-RIM outperforms RIM in terms of execution time, mean reciprocal rank and Spearman's correlation coefficient which makes the framework more stable and reliable, thus, making it suitable for real-time web service selection. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Disposal of waste without treatment is the least preferable way of sustainable solid waste management (SWM). But most cities in developing nations still use open dumps, causing negative impacts on the environment and human health. This study offered a novel approach for selecting landfill sites and sustainable SWM in Aligarh city, India. This was done through data collection, selecting models for criterion weighting, and validation. In order to prepare a landfill site suitability map, a geographic information system (GIS)–based ensemble fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-support vector machine (FAHP-SVM) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-random forest (FAHP-RF) models were implemented. Considering the previous studies and the study area characteristics, eighteen thematic layers were selected. The result revealed that land value; distance from residential roads, hospitals and clinics, and waste bins; and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) have a fuzzy weight greater than 0.10, indicating significant factors. In contrast, land elevation, land slope, surface temperature, soil moisture index, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and urban classification have a zero fuzzy weight, indicating these criteria have no importance. The result further revealed that FAHP-RF with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 is the more accurate model than FAHP-SVM. According to the final weight-based overlay result, seven potential landfill sites were identified, out of which three were determined as most suitable by considering current land cover, public opinions, and environmental and economic concerns. This research proposed a zonal division model based on landfill sites location for sustainable SWM in Aligarh city. However, the findings may provide a guideline to the decision-makers and planners for optimal landfill site selection in other cities of developing countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important machine learning tool used in medical data classification for disease diagnosis. The learning algorithm in ANN training plays a crucial role in classification performance. Various approaches have been successfully applied as a learning algorithm for ANN training. This paper performs an experimental study that investigates the performance of different metaheuristics as learning algorithms to train the ANN for medical data classification tasks. The experiments are carried out on 15 well-known medical datasets. A comparative study is conducted with the classical Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) and other thirteen recent and relevant metaheuristics. Different evaluation criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, Geometric Mean, F-Measure, false-positive rate (FPR) are considered for performance estimation. The classification results are analyzed using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, and the results with analysis establish that the Equilibrium Optimizer algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms included in the comparative study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study is conducted to build a multi-criteria text mining model for COVID-19 testing reasons and symptoms. The model is integrated with a temporal predictive classification model for COVID-19 test results in rural underserved areas. A dataset of 6895 testing appointments and 14 features is used in this study. The text mining model classifies the notes related to the testing reasons and reported symptoms into one or more categories using look-up wordlists and a multi-criteria mapping process. The model converts an unstructured feature to a categorical feature that is used in building the temporal predictive classification model for COVID-19 test results and conducting some population analytics. The classification model is a temporal model (ordered and indexed by testing date) that uses machine learning classifiers to predict test results that are either positive or negative. Two types of classifiers and performance measures that include balanced and regular methods are used: (1) balanced random forest and (2) balanced bagged decision tree. The balanced or weighted methods are used to address and account for the biased and imbalanced dataset and to ensure correct detection of patients with COVID-19 (minority class). The model is tested in two stages using validation and testing sets to ensure robustness and reliability. The balanced classifiers outperformed regular classifiers using the balanced performance measures (balanced accuracy and G-score), which means the balanced classifiers are better at detecting patients with positive COVID-19 results. The balanced random forest achieved the best average balanced accuracy (86.1%) and G-score (86.1%) using the validation set. The balanced bagged decision tree achieved the best average balanced accuracy (83.0%) and G-score (82.8%) using the testing set. Also, it was found that the patient history, age, testing reasons, and time are the key features to classify the testing results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Context: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly developed over the past several decades. Several related AI approaches, such as Machine Learning (ML), have been applied to research on landscape patterns and ecological processes. Objectives: Our goal was to review the methods of AI, particularly ML, used in studies related to landscape ecology and the main topics addressed. We aimed to assess the trend in the number of ML papers and the methods used therein, and provide a synopsis and prospectus of current use and future applications of ML in landscape ecology. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search and selected 125 papers for review. These were examined and scored according to multiple criteria regarding methods and topic. We applied quantitative statistical methods, including cluster analysis based on titles, abstracts, and keywords and a non-metric multidimensional scaling based on attributes assigned during the review. We used Random Forests machine learning to describe the differences between identified clusters in terms of the topics and methods they included. Results: The most frequent method found was Random Forests, but it is noteworthy to mention the increasing popularity of tools related to Deep Learning. The topics cover both ecologically oriented issues and the landscape-human interface. There has been a rapid increase in ML and AI methods in landscape ecology research, with Deep Learning and complex multi-step pipeline AI methods emerging in the last several years. Conclusions: The rapid increase in the number of ML papers in landscape ecology research, and the range of methods employed in them, suggest explosive growth in application of these methods in landscape ecology. The increase of Deep Learning approaches in the most recent years suggest a major change in analytical paradigms and methodologies that we feel may transform the field and enable analyses of more complex pattern process relationships across vaster data sets than has been possible previously. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={This study focuses on suitable site identification for constructing a hospital in Malacca, Malaysia. Using significant environmental, topographic, and geodemographic factors, the study evaluated and compared machine learning (ML) and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) for hospital site suitability mapping to discover the highest influential factors that minimize the error ratio and maximize the effectiveness of the suitability investigation. Identification of the most significant conditioning parameters that impact the choice of an appropriate hospital site was accomplished using correlation-based feature selection (CFS) with a search algorithm (greedy stepwise). To model the potential hospital site map, we utilized multilayer perceptron (MLP) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) models. The outcome of the predicted site models was validated utilizing CFS 10-fold cross-validation, as well as ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve). The analysis of CFS indicated a very high correlation with R2 values of 0.99 for the MLP model. However, the ROC curve indicated a prediction accuracy of 80% for the MLP model and 83% for the AHP model. The findings revealed that the MLP model is reliable and consistent with the AHP. It is a sufficiently promising approach to the location suitability of hospitals to ensure effective planning and performance of healthcare delivery. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The present study intends to improve the robustness of a flood susceptibility (FS) model with a small number of parameters in data-scarce areas, such as northwest Bangladesh, by employing machine learning-based sensitivity analysis and an analytical hierarchy process (AHP). In this study, the nine most relevant flood elements (such as distance from the river, rainfall, and drainage density) were chosen as flood conditioning variables for modeling. The FS model was produced using AHP technique. We used an empirical and binormal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for validating the models. We performed Sensitivity analyses using a random forest (RF)-based mean Gini decline (MGD), mean decrease accuracy (MDA), and information gain ratio to find out the sensitive flood conditioning variables. After performing sensitivity analysis, the least sensitivity variables were eliminated. We re-ran the model with the rest of the parameters to enhance the model’s performance. Based on previous studies and the AHP weighting approach, the general soil type, rainfall, distance from river/canal (Dr), and land use/land cover (LULC) had higher factor weights of 0.22, 0.21, 0.19, and 0.15, respectively. The FS model without sensitivity and with sensitivity performed well in the present study. According to the RF-based sensitivity and information gain ratio, the most sensitive factors were rainfall, soil type, slope, and elevation, while curvature and drainage density were less sensitive parameters, which were excluded in re-running the FS model with just vital parameters. Using empirical and binormal ROC curves, the new FS model yields higher AUCs of 0.835 and 0.822, respectively. It is discovered that the predicted model’s robustness may be maintained or increased by removing less relevant factors. This study will aid decision-makers in developing flood management plans for the examined region. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Increased consumption of water resource due to rapid growth of population has certainly reduced the groundwater storage beneath the earth which leads certain challenges to human being in recent time. For optimal management of this vital resource, exploration of groundwater potential zone (GWPZ) has become essential. We have applied Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Frequency Ratio (FR) and two machine learning techniques specifically Random Forest (RF) and Naïve Bayes (NB) here to delineate GWPZ in Gandheswari River Basin in Chota Nagpur Plateau, India. To achieve the goal of the study, twelve factors that determine occurrence of groundwater have been selected for inter-thematic correlations and overlaid with location of wells. These factors include elevation, drainage density, slope, lithology, geomorphology, topographical wetness index (TWI), distance from the river, rainfall, lineament density, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil, and Land use and Land cover (LULC). A total 170 points including 85 in well site and 85 in non-well site have been selected randomly and allocated into two parts: training and testing at the share of 70:30. The implemented methods have significantly provided five GWPZs specifically Very Good (VG), Good (G), Moderate (M), Poor (P) and Very Poor (VP) with high and acceptable accuracy. The study also finds that geomorphology, slope, rainfall and elevation have greater importance in shaping GWPZs than LULC, NDVI, etc. Model performance has been tested with receiver operator characteristics (ROC), Accuracy (ACC), Kappa Coefficient, MAE, RMSE, etc., methods. Area under curve (AUC) in ROC curve has revealed that accuracy level of AHP, FR, RF and NB is 78.8%, 81%, 85.3% and 85.5, respectively. The machine learning techniques coupled with AHP and FR unveil effective delineation of groundwater potential area in said river basin which by genetically offers low primary porosity due to lithological constrains. Therefore, the study can be helpful in watershed management and identifying appropriate location wells in future. © 2022, The Author(s).},

We also perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis and extensive tuning of the parameters of these models. The results of the energy load application reveal that the learned weights information fusion technique generates the most accurate predictive model. The results unfold that energy consumer can reliably plan for their forecasted energy loads considering expected meteorological conditions.

abstract={Energy benchmarking are used to compare the operational performance of buildings with the corresponding stock. Multi-criteria methods emerged to consider different factors in benchmarking assessment. However, there is a lack in considering occupants’ thermal satisfaction in methods based on actual data. The objective of this article is to propose a method to integrate thermal satisfaction into energy benchmarking. The main innovation is to propose a probabilistic metric that takes into account energy consumption, construction aspects, climate conditions, systems and thermal satisfaction level to benchmark a building. The method consists of a statistical analysis to select relevant variables in the building stock, the process of discretisation of such variables, and the developing and validation of a Bayesian Network to serve as an instrument for the benchmarking method. A detailed evidence-based dataset of 426 schools in Brazil was used. Results showed that buildings with low thermal satisfaction of occupants were benchmarked as less efficient than those with high thermal satisfaction and similar energy consumption. Regarding the validation step, the benchmarking model achieved an error rate ranging from 17.78% to 29.17%. The main conclusion is that machine learning techniques can adequately integrate subjective aspects such as occupant satisfaction in data-driven energy benchmarking methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the era of social media, consumers interact and exchange information, subjective opinions, feelings or thoughts about a given issue, a product or a service, via Web 2.0 technologies. As a result, electronic Word of Mouth, eWOM, has gained increasing influence on the formation of user opinions. Therefore, extracting and analyzing eWOM statements by means of Sentiment Analysis techniques is currently a hot topic that could potentially provide companies with key information about their customers. However, among all the available techniques, choosing the most appropriate one according to the analysis criteria is a real challenge. In this contribution, we first study the main desirable criteria for a sentiment analysis approach and classify the different existing approaches based on these criteria to try and provide a solution to this issue.

abstract={The catalytic dry reforming (DR) process is a clean approach to transform CO2 into H2 and CO-rich synthetic gas that can be used for various energy applications such as Fischer–Tropsch fuels production. A novel framework is proposed to determine the optimum reaction configurations and reaction pathways for DR of C1-C4 hydrocarbons via a reaction mechanism generator (RMG). With the aid of machine learning, the variation of thermodynamic and microkinetic parameters based on different reaction temperatures, pressures, CH4/CO2 ratios and catalytic surface, Pt(111), and Ni(111), were successfully elucidated. As a result, a promising multicriteria decision-making process, TOPSIS, was employed to identify the optimum reaction configuration with the trade-off between H2 yield and CO2 reduction. Notably, the optimum conditions for the DR of C1 and C2 hydrocarbons were 800°C at 3 atm on Pt(111); whereas C3 and C4 hydrocarbons found favor at 800°C and 2 atm on Ni(111) to attain the highest H2 yield and CO2 conversion. Based on the RMG-Cat (first-principle microkinetic database), the energy profile of the most selective reaction pathway network for the DR of CH4 on Pt(111) at 3 atm and 800°C was deducted. The activation energy (Ea) for C-H bond dissociation via dehydrogenation on the Pt(111) was found to be 0.60 eV, lower than that reported previously for Ni(111), Cu(111), and Co(111) surfaces. The most endothermic reaction of the CH4 reforming process was found to be C3H3* + H2O* ↔ OH* + C3H4 (218.74 kJ/mol). © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Despite recent advances in Machine Learning (ML)-based applications for clinical decision making, there is no objective method that can assist physicians in discriminating clinically significant features for predicting the prognosis of hepatitis. To this purpose, an expert-based objective feature engineering (FE) method is required to complement the physician’s subjective multi-criteria decision making and ML-based feature sets. Thus, this study proposes a novel feature selection (FS) method, which blends neighbourhood component analysis (NCA) and ReliefF by averaging their outcomes, coupled with a Lagrangian Support Vector Machine (LSVM) leveraged as an ML-based classifier for decision support to aid a binary classification of prognosis (survival or death) in patients with chronic hepatitis. Using this syncretic FS technique, which integrates the best performing FS methods tested, averaged feature ranks are obtained. Clinical data on 320 patients with hepatitis were obtained from two benchmark datasets from the University of California-Irvine database. The performance of the hybrid algorithms resulting from using statistical- and ML-based FE, both individually and in a syncretic manner, i.e., via a multi-expert ML system, was evaluated and compared. The proposed hybrid classifier NCA-ReliefF-LSVM, using an ML-based syncretic FS, led to the highest classification performance (AUC = 0.97/F1-score = 97.51, and AUC = 0.94/F1-score = 94.57) and the lowest computational cost (1 and 2 epochs, 13 and 11.67 s respectively) amongst all algorithms tested on both benchmark datasets. Thus, this study strongly supports the use of ML-based syncretic FS for predicting survival in individuals affected by hepatitis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Many advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are based on decision making, especially in uncertain settings. Due to its possible applications, decision making is currently a broad field of study in many areas like Computation, Economics and Business Management. The first techniques appeared in scenarios where information was modeled by real numbers. In all cases, one of the key steps in such processes was the summarization of the available information into a few values that helped the decision maker to complete this task. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-criteria decision making methodology in the fuzzy context in which weights and experts’ opinions (may be translated by linguistic labels) are stated as triangular fuzzy numbers. To do that, we take advantage of a recently presented fuzzy binary relation whose properties are according to human intuition and we carry out a study of the main properties that an aggregation function (a mapping to sum up information) must satisfy in the fuzzy framework. The presented procedure makes a final decision based on parabolic fuzzy numbers (not triangular). And this will be shown in an illustrative example. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the present study, a new methodology for reference evapotranspiration (ETo) prediction and uncertainty analysis under climate change and COVID-19 post-pandemic recovery scenarios for the period 2021–2050 at nine stations in the two basins of Lake Urmia and Sefidrood is presented. For this purpose, firstly ETo data were estimated using meteorological data and the FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) method. Then, ETo modeling by six machine learning techniques including multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple non-linear regression (MNLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), model tree M5 (M5), random forest (RF) and least-squares boost (LSBoost) was carried out. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was used under seven scenarios to rank models with evaluation and time criteria in the next step. After proving the acceptable performance of the LSBoost model, the downscaling of temperature (T) and precipitation (P) by the delta change factor (CF) method under three models ACCESS-ESM1-5, CanESM5 and MRI-ESM2-0 (scenarios SSP245-cov-fossil (SCF), SSP245-cov-modgreen (SCM) and SSP245-cov-strgreen (SCS)) was performed. The results showed that the monthly changes in the average T increases at all stations for all scenarios. Also, the average monthly change ratio of P increases in most stations and scenarios. In the next step, ETo forecasting under climate change for periods (2021–2050) was performed using the best model. Prediction results showed that ETo increases in all scenarios and stations in a pessimistic and optimistic state. In addition, the Monte Carlo method (MCM) showed that the lowest uncertainty is related to the Mianeh station in the MRI-ESM2-0 model and SCS scenario. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The formation of patterns is one of the main stages in logical data analysis. Fuzzy approaches to pattern generation in logical analysis of data allow the pattern to cover not only objects of the target class, but also a certain proportion of objects of the opposite class. In this case, pattern search is an optimization problem with the maximum coverage of the target class as an objective function, and some allowed coverage of the opposite class as a constraint. We propose a more flexible and symmetric optimization model which does not impose a strict restriction on the pattern coverage of the opposite class observations. Instead, our model converts such a restriction (purity restriction) into an additional criterion. Both, coverage of the target class and the opposite class are two objective functions of the optimization problem. The search for a balance of these criteria is the essence of the proposed optimization method. We propose a modified evolutionary algorithm based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to solve this problem. The new algorithm uses pattern formation as an approximation of the Pareto set and considers the solution’s representation in logical analysis of data and the informativeness of patterns. We have tested our approach on two applied medical problems of classification under conditions of sample asymmetry: one class significantly dominated the other. The classification results were comparable and, in some cases, better than the results of commonly used machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy, without losing the interpretability. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Fire risk will increase in the upcoming years due to climate change. In this context, GIS analysis for fire risk mapping is an important tool to identify high risk areas and allocate resources. In the present study, we aimed to create a fire risk estimation model that incorporates recent land cover changes, along with other important risk factors. As a study area, we selected Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli National Forest Park and the surrounding area since it is one of the most important protected areas in Greece. The area selected for the case study is a typical Mediterranean landscape. As a result, the outcome model is generic and can be applied to other areas. In order to incorporate land cover changes in our model, we used a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify a satellite image captured in September 2021 and an image of the same period two years ago to obtain comparable results. Next, two fire risk maps were created with a combination of land cover and six other factors, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) on a GIS platform. The results of our model revealed noticeable clusters of extreme high risk areas, while the overall fire risk in the National Park Forest of Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli was classified as high. The wildfires of 1st October 2020 and 9th July 2021 confirmed our model and contributed to quantification of their impact on fire risk due to land cover change. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Wireless networks and the Internet of things (IoT) have proven rapid growth in the development and management of smart environments. These technologies are applied in numerous research fields, such as security surveillance, Internet of vehicles, medical systems, etc. The sensor technologies and IoT devices are cooperative and allow the collection of unpredictable factors from the observing field. However, the constraint resources of distributed battery-powered sensors decrease the energy efficiency of the IoT network and increase the delay in receiving the network data on users’ devices. It is observed that many solutions are proposed to overcome the energy deficiency in smart applications; though, due to the mobility of the nodes, lots of communication incurs frequent data discontinuity, compromising the data trust. Therefore, this work introduces a D2D multi-criteria learning algorithm for IoT networks using secured sensors, which aims to improve the data exchange without imposing additional costs and data diverting for mobile sensors. Moreover, it reduces the compromising threats in the presence of anonymous devices and increases the trustworthiness of the IoT-enabled communication system with the support of machine learning. The proposed work was tested and analyzed using broad simulation-based experiments and demonstrated the significantly improved performance of the packet delivery ratio by 17%, packet disturbances by 31%, data delay by 22%, energy consumption by 24%, and computational complexity by 37% for realistic network configurations. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Cluster-based routing is the most common routing approach to achieve energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks. However, optimal determination of cluster heads is NP-hard, which calls for heuristics or metaheuristics for obtaining a near-optimal solution. Although metaheuristics achieve better performance, they suffer from high computational time, and thus, cannot rapidly respond to routing requests. Also, a large majority of the existing routing protocols cannot easily adapt to changing network or application configurations. In this paper, a Combined model based on Metaheuristics and Machine Learning, named CMML, is proposed to support efficient and adaptable routing in clustered wireless sensor networks. In our CMML model, a multi-criteria heuristic clustering algorithm is used for clustering in which a metaheuristic (e.g., genetic algorithm) is utilized for the automatic tuning of the heuristic algorithm for each configuration separately. We repeat this process for several configurations (i.e., for different network sizes, numbers of nodes, aggregation factors, lifetime definitions, etc.). The tuned heuristic algorithm in each configuration is subsequently used for network simulation to obtain the corresponding solution. As a result, a comprehensive dataset for different configurations is derived, which is used to train a machine learning model (e.g., support vector machine). The input feature vector of a sample comprises local features (current state of a node at a round), global features (current state of the network), and application-specific features, while the output is the priority factor of each node to be selected as a cluster head. After training the CMML model, it can be applied as a quickly adaptable clustering protocol. In fact, our motivation is to utilize the generalizability of machine learning to learn the behavioral pattern of the metaheuristic algorithm in finding best routes for previous configurations. Simulation results demonstrate that the CMML model can effectively adapt with different applications, while prolonging the network lifetime based on the application requirements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Traditional methodologies of flood monitoring are generally time-consuming and demanding tasks. In most cases, there is no possibility of flood monitoring in large areas. Due to the major drawbacks of conventional methods in flood detection of large districts, Remote Sensing (RS) has been efficiently employed as the best solution owing to its being synoptic view and cost-effective methodologies. One of the most challenging issues in RS technologies is choosing the optimal spectral bands to detect changes in the natural environment. In this research, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), as one of the most widely used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, was applied to select the optimal bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images for detection of flood-affected areas. For this purpose, the decision-making method was implemented during ten options and six criteria. The properties of the Sentinel-2 satellite images consisted of ten bands (with 10 and 20m spatial resolutions) and the criteria are the signal to noise ratio (SNR) related to sensor, standard deviation, variance, the SNR related to the bands, spatial resolution, and wavelength. Afterward, the ELECTRE technique was used to select six optimal bands among ten bands. The ELECTRE algorithm was programmed in MATLAB programming language that could make decisions with multiple options and multiple criteria. Furthermore, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method, as one of the most powerful Machine Learning (ML) models, has been applied to classify the water bodies related to before and after the flood. According to the results of optimal bands classification, Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) for the pre-flood classification were 93.65 percent and 0.923, respectively, and for the post-flood classification, the OA and KC values were 94.52 percent and 0.935 respectively. In the case of before and after flooding, the results of classification model for optimal bands had more accuracy levels in comparison with those obtained by original bands. Generally, it was found that the ELECTRE technique for selecting the best bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images and detection of flood-affected areas, in a short period of time with high accuracy, offers remarkable and consistent results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the context of Industry 4.0, process automation and predictive maintenance play an essential role. There is a need to provide more effective and faster maintenance through the integration of industrial tools and processes, to support manufacturing operations, in the perspective of integration standards and architectures. In a typical maintenance system, registration and maintenance requests are made through maintenance orders, which consist of a standard form and usually are created and filled manually. However, predictive maintenance requires a higher level of automatization, from data acquisition to maintenance order generation in a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) / Enterprise Asset Management (EAM). The proposal is to automate the process of generating maintenance orders, providing for automated form completion. At the physical level, assets are monitored by sensors, and, based on a set of rules, the respective predictive maintenance order will be issued in CMMS/EAS. Maintenance orders may contain variable fields according to each asset, so Machine Learning (ML) and Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) will be applied to fill in these fields, as well as the allocation of the maintenance orders to the maintainer that best fit for the maintenance specification. This automatic process will assist the maintenance workflow, leading to a Smart Workflow concept. A serial and parallel framework are presented, the former consists in applying TOPSIS (MCDM method) to extract features for the use in ML classification, in order to automatically fill in the appropriate form fields. The latter consists in a classification using both methods (ML and MCDM), where TOPSIS performs the initial classification, and if the alternatives ranking scores are close to each other, ML is used for more accurate classification. A case study was carried out in a Brazilian company that develops a CMMS/EAM system, distributed worldwide, and the results demonstrate that the concept of Smart Workflows is valuable, simplifying and enhancing maintenance processes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective. We propose a semiautomatic pipeline for radiation therapy treatment planning, combining ideas from machine learning-automated planning and multicriteria optimization (MCO). Approach. Using knowledge extracted from historically delivered plans, prediction models for spatial dose and dose statistics are trained and furthermore systematically modified to simulate changes in tradeoff priorities, creating a set of differently biased predictions. Based on the predictions, an MCO problem is subsequently constructed using previously developed dose mimicking functions, designed in such a way that its Pareto surface spans the range of clinically acceptable yet realistically achievable plans as exactly as possible. The result is an algorithm outputting a set of Pareto optimal plans, either fluence-based or machine parameter-based, which the user can navigate between in real time to make adjustments before a final deliverable plan is created. Main results. Numerical experiments performed on a dataset of prostate cancer patients show that one may often navigate to a better plan than one produced by a single-plan-output algorithm. Significance. We demonstrate the potential of merging MCO and a data-driven workflow to automate labor-intensive parts of the treatment planning process while maintaining a certain extent of manual control for the user. © 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract={In recent decades, the development of technology and the increase of living standards have affected people's attention in healthcare. The healthcare market has expanded along with great attention from researchers, and the study of disease forecasting has become an inevitable process in future healthcare development. Cardiovascular disease is a category for the type of disease that causes a negative impact on the heart and blood vessels. As one of the most common and lethal potential diseases, predicting cardiovascular diseases helped in high-risk patients' decision-making process, which identifies the potential threats in the early stages. With the help of tremendous medical data and increased computational capabilities, machine learning has proved one of the most efficient prediction methods in cardiovascular disease forecasting. However, most of the proposed research either focuses on single algorithms with different parameter settings or large-scale selected algorithms with single criteria for modeling. This experiment aims to study the performance of small-scale selected algorithms with multiple criteria used in the modeling process. Specifically, this study used historical healthcare data with fourteen attributes selected. The experiment results show the Random Forest built by Classification and Regression Trees (CART) has dominant performance among all selected algorithms, which can help construct an alert system for cardiovascular disease prediction. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the impact of using different types of occupancy prediction models on the performance of occupancy-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control systems in residential buildings. The future occupancy prediction problem is approached from two different viewpoints: 1) as a regression task for arrival-time prediction and 2) as a classification task for occupancy-state prediction. Four machine learning techniques, namely decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), multi-layer perceptron, and gated recurrent units, are implemented to predict future occupancy from each perspective. The performance of the occupancy models is evaluated in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy, and the ability to provide occupants’ thermal comfort and to save energy. An overall performance score is proposed by making a trade-off between the energy and thermal comfort objectives using the technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution method. The results demonstrate that selecting the optimal viewpoint has a higher impact on the control performance than selecting the machine learning techniques, with occupancy-state prediction models providing superior performance in most cases. It is also shown that the machine learning evaluation metrics (i.e., MAE and accuracy) provide a weak to moderate correlation with the overall performance score. Consequently, relying solely on the MAE and accuracy might fail to provide a reliable evaluation of the occupancy model performance for use in HVAC control systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Landslide susceptibility analysis is vital for understanding precursors, associated risk, and early rescue operations. In the past, numerous attempts have been made to develop landslide susceptibility maps using various tools. This research work aims to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) by developing a deep multi-layer perceptron network named as DMLP-LSM and to demonstrate it over Srinagar-Rudraprayag region, a landslide prone region recognized by the Geological Survey of India (GSI). Initially, training datasets are generated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) enabled multi-criteria analysis, which involves information from various landslide causative factors. In a first, one dimensional line of sight (1D LOS) velocity, one of the critical inputs and prominent indicator for landslide susceptibility, is generated by processing 60 Sentinel-1A scenes using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) algorithm. The 1D LOS velocity map, generally used for quantitative monitoring slow moving landslides, is used here as a thematic layer. The thematic layers and LSMs were fed to the proposed DMLP-LSM network as input and output, respectively. The developed model reached an accuracy of 91.47% with precision, specificity and ROC_AUC score as 92.11%, 95.55% and 0.9072, respectively. It further identified nearly 15 square km area as susceptible to landslide. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with two well-known machine learning models for LSM preparation, namely support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). In terms of accuracy, DMLP-LSM and RF had similar performance, but better than SVM. The velocity maps derived from MT-InSAR processing played a prominent role in the generation of LSM, supporting model training and performance. The proposed model achieved highest precision and specificity, and its performance would also improve LSM preparation when using larger datasets. The obtained results are promising, and the trained model can help in the rapid generation of LSMs. © 2021 COSPAR},

abstract={Snow avalanches cause economic losses in many parts of the world, especially in mountainous areas. Due to its changing climates and the complex topography of mountainous regions in Iran, avalanches are significant problems. Therefore, modeling snow avalanches to predict them is essential for sustainable and safe development, appropriate infrastructure, planning for residential development, and loss prevention. This study assesses the performances of multi-criteria decision-making models and machine-learning hybrid models for snow avalanche susceptibility mapping in northwestern Iran's Sirvan watershed based on the weight of analytic network process, weighted linear combination, and frequency ratio. Using multicollinearity analysis and Pearson correlation, eleven snow avalanche conditioning factors were deemed appropriate for use. The areas under the curve (AUC), root mean square error (RMSE), seed cell area index, and snow avalanche relative index were used to validate snow avalanche susceptibility maps. The results showed that all hybrid models performed very well for the determination of the susceptibility of locations to avalanching. Based on the results of the validation analyses, the analytic network process-frequency ratio hybrid model was best among the models (AUC = 0.941, RMSE = 0.3). The resulting maps provide strong evidence to guide efforts to prevent the exposure to snow avalanches in the Sirvan watershed, and these hybrid models can be tested in other regions affected by snow avalanches. © 2021},

abstract={CONTEXT: India's increasing population growth and unsystematic land cover transformation have led to land degradation and a decline in agricultural production. To achieve optimum advantage from the land, proper exploitation of its resources is necessary. Remote sensing, advanced fuzzy logic, and multi-criteria decision-making like analytical hierarchy process (AHP) integrated agricultural land suitability analysis (ALAS) may facilitate identifying and formulating effective agricultural management strategies required for smart agriculture. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to construct India's robust agricultural suitability model by developing hybrid fuzzy logic and the AHP based model. METHODS: Fourteen topographical, climatological, soil-related, land-use, and land-cover-related factors were prepared and employed to model agricultural suitability. Agricultural suitability models predicted multi-parameters based agricultural suitable zones for the entire country using three fuzzy operators (AND, Gamma 0.8, Gamma 0.9) and a hybrid fuzzy-AHP model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the models' reliability using Moris technique-based global sensitivity analysis, random forest (RF), and correlation coefficient. The best agricultural suitable model was compared with the production of major crops in India. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that 19.8% of the study area was permanently not suitable in the northernmost region, 19.7% was currently not suitable in the northernmost region, while 20.1% and 20.2% areas were predicted as moderately suitable and highly suitable zones, respectively. The rainfall, elevation, slopes, evapotranspiration, and aridity index had a prime influence on the output of the agricultural suitability model. SIGNIFICANCE: The adopted method and its application processes can analyze agricultural land suitability and recommend optimal farming methods. It is also comprehended as a promising option for meeting food, nutrition, energy, and job demands while still protecting our threatened environment. © 2021},

abstract={Hybrid energy systems (HESs) are one of the most effective solutions for the power demand especially in remote areas. It is well-known that the HESs usually include renewables like solar and/or wind energy sources. Renewables are intermittent, fluctuating, and nonlinear. Therefore, an effective energy management plays an essential role in organizing the power flow in hybrid energy sources. In this work, a hybrid energy system (HES) composed of wind, gasoline and diesel generator is used as a case study to electrify a specific remote area. The sources of the HES are categorized in different arrangements to select the best combination from all available six energy sources combinations based on five criteria using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). This work is divided into two stages, in the first stage; a historical demand side dataset is used to model and calculate the five criteria. TOPSIS method results are combined with the five criteria and the demand side to form a dataset. In the second stage, machine learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF) and light gradient boosted machine (LightGBM) algorithms are used to predict the combination of the energy sources as a way of validating the proposed work. Evaluating the algorithms shows the superiority of RF algorithm with accuracy of 81.81% over LightGBM with accuracy of 68.6%. The behavior of both algorithms is explained using the confusion matrix. RF algorithm classifies the classes G1G2, and G2 correctly and misclassifies some values of the other classes. On the other hand, LightGBM algorithm classifies the class G2 correctly and misclassifies some values of the other classes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Classical machine learning models typically try to optimize the model based on the most discriminatory features of the data; however, they do not usually account for end user preferences. In certain applications, this can be a serious issue as models not aware of user preferences could become costly, untrustworthy, or privacy-intrusive to use, thus becoming irrelevant and/or uninterpretable. Ideally, end users with domain knowledge could propose preferable features that the predictive model could then take into account. In this paper, we propose a generic modeling method that respects end user preferences via a relative ranking system to express multi-criteria preferences and a regularization term in the model's objective function to incorporate the ranked preferences. In a more generic perspective, this method is able to plug user preferences into existing predictive models without creating completely new ones. We implement this method in the context of decision trees and are able to achieve a comparable classification accuracy while reducing the use of undesirable features. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

Since children in divorced families are regularly supported by only one parent, that is, the custodial parent [ 3 ], the supporting family usually faces financial crisis due to the double pressure of supporting the children on a single income source. In many cases, the children would not have sufficient income without support from the noncustodial parent.},

abstract={Brain tissue segmentation in multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is significant for the clinical diagnosis of brain diseases. Due to blurred boundaries, low contrast, and intricate anatomical relationships between brain tissue regions, automatic brain tissue segmentation without prior knowledge is still challenging. This paper presents a novel 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) for brain tissue segmentation, called APRNet. In this network, we first propose a 3D anisotropic pyramidal convolutional reversible residual sequence (3DAPC-RRS) module to integrate the intra-slice information with the inter-slice information without significant memory consumption; secondly, we design a multi-modal cross-dimension attention (MCDA) module to automatically capture the effective information in each dimension of multi-modal images; then, we apply 3DAPC-RRS modules and MCDA modules to a 3D FCN with multiple encoded streams and one decoded stream for constituting the overall architecture of APRNet. We evaluated APRNet on two benchmark challenges, namely MRBrainS13 and iSeg-2017. The experimental results show that APRNet yields state-of-the-art segmentation results on both benchmark challenge datasets and achieves the best segmentation performance on the cerebrospinal fluid region. Compared with other methods, our proposed approach exploits the complementary information of different modalities to segment brain tissue regions in both adult and infant MR images, and it achieves the average Dice coefficient of 87.22% and 93.03% on the MRBrainS13 and iSeg-2017 testing data, respectively. The proposed method is beneficial for quantitative brain analysis in the clinical study, and our code is made publicly available. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, different higher order fuzzy sets have been introduced to better handle the uncertainty in many practical decision making and data mining problems. The recent proposal of higher order fuzzy set is q-rung picture fuzzy set (q-RPFS) modeled by three parameters positive, negative, and neutral membership function. One of the important topics in q-RPFS is distance measures which play a crucial role in many multi criteria decision making methods and data mining applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel distance measure for q-RPFS which is the combination of q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) and picture fuzzy set (PFS). The proposed distance measure is used in q-rung picture fuzzy (q-RPF) ELECTRE integrated with TOPSIS as a new approach for group decision making in q-RPF environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, a comparison is made with the q-RPF approach based on aggregation operators using a numerical example for decision making problem. Furthermore, the proposed distance measure is utilized in a q-RPF k nearest neighborhood (kNN) algorithm for classification. The proposed classification algorithm is applied to twenty UCI machine learning classification data sets. A comparison with other algorithms is performed and the results show that the proposed classification algorithm has the highest average classification accuracy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The drift caused by gas sensors has always been a bottleneck in the development of electronic nose (E-nose) systems. Traditional drift compensation methods directly correct the drift components, making such approaches time-consuming and laborious. In the field of E-nose drift compensation, cross-domain adaption learning is an efficient technique. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace alignment extreme learning machine (SAELM) that considers multiple criteria to construct a unified extreme learning machine (ELM)-based feature representation space and thus achieve domain alignment. First, the method minimizes both the geometric and statistical distributions between different domains. Second, the dependence between features and labels is enhanced using the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) to alleviate the blurring of the correspondence between the two caused by drift. Third, to improve the feature extraction ability of the subspace learning method, the l2,1 norm is leveraged to constrain the output weights of the ELM. The aim of this method is to learn a robust subspace to increase the consistency between domains and enhance the feature–label​ dependency of the source domain while preserving the intrinsic information of both domains. Extensive experiments on sensor drift data are conducted, and the proposed SAELM method yields the greatest improvements on E-nose drift datasets. © 2021},

abstract={It has always been the goal of many researchers to gain a thorough understanding of the patterns in the stock market and forecast the trends it will follow. The use of an advanced forecasting model can assist with accurately forecasting the future price of stocks, their fluctuations in the markets, as well as make profits in trading. With this motivation, in this study, a novel stock index trend predictor model is designed by integrating Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) with an optimized Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSELM). Forecasting the future stock index prices and analyzing the upward or downward trends of these price forecasts are the two objectives of the proposed model. As the performance of OSELM is heavily dependent on the activation functions used in it, suitable selection of the activation function for OSELM is addressed as a MCDM problem. According to this approach, the trend prediction performance of six popular activation functions is assessed based on five regression-based and five classification-based criteria. In this investigation, three MCDM approaches are used to assess the performance matrix and determine which activation function is the best for OSELM based on six alternative models and ten criteria. To further optimize OSELM's performance, a hybrid crow search algorithm (hCSA) is incorporated in its training phase. By introducing the chaotic map and mutation operator in position update scheme and catfish behavior in the search process of original CSA, the proposed hCSA is able to achieve the right balance between exploration and exploitation improving the convergence. The proposed trend predictor model is empirically evaluated over historical data of three stock indices such as BSE SENSEX, S&P 500 and DJIA collected during pre-COVID and COVID time frame. In most of the test cases, the hCSA-OSELM model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of all evaluation criteria. When compared to the second-best baseline model, the suggested model is able to achieve the MSE improvements of 4–6%, 25–31%, and accuracy improvements of 0.4–0.8%, 0.9–1.3% over the pre-COVID and COVID time-frames, respectively. The statistical test also reveals the better performance of the proposed model. The robust and reliable MCDM-based model selection, superior prediction and classification outcomes clearly reveal that the proposed model can be used for financial time-series forecasting amid daily volatility as well as highly volatile markets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Sustainable management of groundwater resource is a most critical due to its over exploitation and ascending stress by industrial and socio-economic factors. It is utmost important to manage this precious resource by properly identifying the suitable Groundwater Potential Zones (GPZ). Therefore, the main aim of the present study is to delineate the GPZ in the upper Godavari sub-basin of India by employing different bi-variate, Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), ensembled, and Machine Learning (ML) models. These models include Weight of Evidence (WoE) (bi-variate), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) (MCDM), Fuzzified Functional Ratio (F-FR) (bi-variate), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) (ML) and Extremely randomized Trees (ET) ML. The ensembled model featured different combination of WoE, TOPSIS and F-FR for mapping the enhanced accuracy in predicting the GPZ. A total of 15 groundwater factors were considered where 75% of the data were selected as training data and the rest 25% as validation data. These data were used to produce the ensembled ML models. The result of the model was plotted in terms of area under curve (AUC)-Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and selected best model. The AUC-ROC result of the obtained model was found to be WoE oE models. The result of the model was plotted in termWoE_TOPSIS = 94%, WoE_F-FR = 93%, TOPSIS_F-FR = 94% and WoE_TOPSIS_F-FR = 95%. Results clearly indicate the improved accuracy of ensembled bi-variate and MCDM model over advanced ML model. The predicted statistical properties of the ensembled model also resembled ML models and a high correlation was observed. Thus, the ensembled model can be used over advanced ML models for delineating the GPZ mapping. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Airline operators are looking for ways to improve flight performance and flight safety, and to minimize maintenance-repair costs and the number of unplanned breakdowns over time. It is exceedingly difficult to achieve optimal results in such a large system with hundreds of variable factors. However, technological developments facilitate the exchange of data between interrelated operational activities and make it meaningful by processing the big data that emerges from the operations performed. In this sense, artificial intelligence (AI) concept has started to be a big supporter of maintenance-repair-overhaul (MRO) companies. In this research, it will be carried out to determine the most appropriate area in which AI technology can be used in aviation MRO activities, and to detect the most suitable AI tool for this determined area via multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. VIKOR method is used to determine which of these potential processes is more suitable for this technology, and the most appropriate AI tool for this specified process is determined by the TODIM method. As a result of the study, it has been determined that the “predictive and preventive maintenance” is the most suitable area and “Alternative-6” out of 11 alternative AI tools was found to be the most suitable alternative for this area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Real-world complex systems, such as transportation and insurance systems, have constantly produced massive data, and the variables used to capture their variability may be overwhelming. Therefore, it is important to balance the model’s interpretability and prediction accuracy when building a predictive model. Keeping a balance on these two aspects may significantly improve prediction reliability and maintain key knowledge or information from complex systems so that the overall control and management of the complex system are statistically optimal. The paper proposes a novel approach for variable selection based on the importance measures from different data sources or different types of measures of importance obtained from machine learning models. The method formulates the variable selection problem in terms of multi-criteria decision analysis. It aims to bring a systematic way for decision-making in terms of variable selection to build more interpretable predictive models. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={A classic example of machine learning methods is machine classification algorithms. At present, a large number of machine classification methods have been developed, which are offered in the form of ready-made software. The presence of a large number of machine classification algorithms raises the problem of choosing the best algorithm for solving a particular task. This problem is also complicated by the ambiguity with the choice of quality indicators since for the analysis of the quality of the classification there exist a number of indicators (metrics) of the classification. It is difficult for an inexperienced user to understand and choose his priorities. However, the problem of evaluating the classification algorithm's quality can be considered a problem of multicriteria decision-making. It is proposed to evaluate the algorithm's quality by means of one scalar indicator obtained by convolution of other indicators by a nonlinear scheme of compromises. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

abstract={Frequent modifications in the software leads to the issues in the code which deteriorates software quality. The suitable approach to rectify it is to refactor it. Consequently, this research devises a ranking using the MCDM approach for prioritizing Python-based code smells. This order ranking has been studied over 10,552 classes for five generic code smells diffused in 20 Python software. The software metrics extracted over these python classes have been considered as multiple criteria which are processed using rule-based machine learning approach. In this study, an approach providing compromised solution—VIKOR have been practiced along with TOPSIS and WASPAS methods. Additionally, the MCDM approaches have utilized Shannon’s Entropy and CRITIC method as weight estimation techniques. The extracted vital software metrics achieved over 90% accuracy. The prominent outcome portrays that the most dominant smell is Collapsible “IF” which needs to be refactored at the early stage. This should be accompanied by Cognitive Complexity smell so as to attain sustainable development environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={This article presents a framework to cluster buildings into typologically similar groups and select indicator buildings for regional seismic response and damage analysis. The framework requires a robust database of buildings to provide high-level structural and site information of buildings. Here, a database of 234 reinforced concrete buildings with five or more above-ground stories in the central business district of Wellington, New Zealand, has been selected as the case study of this research. First, key structural and site parameters that contribute to the seismic demand, response, and damage of each building are extracted from the database. Extracted parameters comprise three numerical and five categorical attributes of each building, including the year of construction, height, period, lateral load resisting system, floor system, site subsoil class, importance level, and strong motion station. Next, two prominent unsupervised machine learning clustering approaches are utilized to cluster the mixed categorical and numerical building database: k-prototype on the mixed numerical and categorical database and k-means on principal components numerical subspace adopted from factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD). A novel autoencoder deep learning neural network is also designed and trained to convert the mixed data into a low-dimensional subspace called latent space and feed this into k-means for clustering. The proposed autoencoder method is demonstrated to be more effective at clustering buildings into useful typological clusters for seismic response and damage analysis based on multiple criteria from both data-science and engineering perspectives. The details of selected indicator buildings for each similar seismic vulnerability cluster are also represented. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={The COVID-19 infestation has resulted in the loss of the lives of millions of people and the destruction of commercial, communal, and healthcare systems around the world. To control these kinds of pandemics, complete knowledge of the traits and responses to the disease is required, and this knowledge can be gathered using various computational methods. These computational techniques can be very helpful in information building required for taking appropriate action timely and applying preventive mechanisms. Although there are numerous computational approaches that the researchers are applying over the past few months, there is a need to re-evaluate and compare these available techniques for finding out the best technique that can help reduce the extent of COVID-19. Hence, in this paper, we carried out a literature review to emphasize the assistance of various computational approaches around COVID-19. The paper presents a categorization of approaches such as multicriteria decision-making, fuzzy AHP, machine learning, neural network, and data science that have been used to deal with the epidemic. Furthermore, this study discusses various challenges experienced when accessing the COVID-19 data. The conclusions of the paper propose the best computational approach among all to be appraised for future investigations and implementations. © 2022 Amandeep Kaur et al.},

abstract={The training phase is the most crucial stage during the machine learning process. In the case of labeled data and supervised learning, machine learning entails minimizing the loss function under various constraints. We provide an innovative model for learning with numerous data sets, resulting from the application of multicriteria optimization techniques to existing deep learning algorithms. Data fitting is formulated as a multicriteria model in which each criterion measures the data fitting error on a specific data set. This is an optimization model involving a vector-valued function, and it has to be analyzed using the notion of Pareto efficiency. We present stability results for efficient solutions in the presence of input and output data perturbations. The multiple data set environment comes into play to eliminate the bias caused by the selection of a specific training set. To apply this concept, we present a scalarization strategy as well as numerical experiments in digit classification using MNIST data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this article, the feature selection (FS) process is taken as a multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. Also, to consider the impreciseness arising in the real time data, the values of the decision matrix procured after the ridge regression is fuzzified into dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy set. For the information fusion process, we have proposed various aggregation operators such as the Dual Hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted Dombi arithmetic aggregation operator, Dual Hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted Dombi geometric aggregation operator, Dual Hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy ordered weighted Dombi arithmetic aggregation operator and Dual Hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy ordered weighted Dombi geometric aggregation operator. A multi-label feature selection method is proposed using these MCDM techniques formed by the aggregation operators. This algorithm, initially, obtains the values of the decision matrix through the process of ridge regression. The weight vector required for the MCDM process is calculated using entropy. Further, the data are fuzzified and the MCDM process proposed using the aforementioned aggregation operators are utilized. A rank vector is obtained by utilizing the score function to select the desired number of features. It should be noted that through changing the aggregation operator, the algorithm can be altered. Experimental evaluation that compares the proposed method to other existing methods in terms of evaluation metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method and their significance is also evaluated. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This article evaluates several machine learning methods to substitute the missing light detection and ranging data for better spatial localization of industrial automated guided vehicles. Decision trees and ensemble of trees using bagging or boosting techniques have been considered. Also, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm was analyzed. Most of the algorithms have been evaluated based on multiple criteria and hyper parameter tuning. The analysis of the results was done in a comparative way, multiple regression evaluation metrics being considered. The experiments have shown that the extreme gradient boosting algorithm provides the best results in terms of performance, but with timing and resource allocation drawbacks. On the other hand, a simple decision tree model seems to give good results if a tradeoff between performance and prediction time must be made. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is also performing pretty well, especially because we are experimenting in a static environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={To date, for the purpose of solving the complex problems in the area of expert system, Multi criteria decision making is the best technique to offer the suitable solution. In the academic literature, the MCDM methods suffered from many challenges. The most important challenges are uncertainty and vagueness. One of the latest MCDM method, called the fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM). However, there are still some vagueness issues around these methods (mention some of them). According to the advantage of the Fermatean fuzzy set in solving these issues, in this research extends FDOSM into Fermatean-FDOSM so as to effectively benchmark the real-life problem. In this study, we present our methodology in two phases. The first phase presents the mathematical model of Fermatean-FDOSM which is composed of three stages of FDOSM. The second phase applied the new extension to benchmark the COVID-19 machine learning methods. The finding of Fermatean-FDOSM after comparing the result with the basic FDSOM and TOPSIS, is more logical and undergoing a systematic ranking. In the validation process, objective validation is applied to validate the final result of Fermatean-FDOSM. The result of Fermatean-FDOSM is valid, and more logical and in line with decision makers' opinions. © 2022 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The primary objective of this study was to develop a novel data-driven machine learning-based multiobjective robust optimisation strategy to improve the overall quality of multivariate manufacturing processes. The new strategy was conceptualised considering a manufacturing environment with unreplicated non-normal data observations and limited opportunity for off-line sequential design of experiments. At a macro level, the new strategy adopts suitable artificial intelligence-based process models and a fine-tuned non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to derive robust efficient process setting conditions. These robust solutions are iteratively derived considering process model predictive uncertainties, process setting sensitivities, and variance-covariance structure of uncontrollable multivariate non-normal inputs (or covariates). These solutions are also ranked based on multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques to facilitate implementation. In this study, the quality of the best-ranked solutions was compared (w.r.t. closeness to specified multiple targets and predicted multivariate output variabilities) with those of the solutions obtained from parametric and commercial software-based approaches using three different real-life manufacturing cases. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 drove a mass technological revolution in manufacturing and supply chain management. The introduction of cyber systems, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and smart manufacturing helped with the development of a personalized manufacturing strategy and reinforced the switch from the traditional industrial processes to an automated machinery. This radical change is led by the belief that a connected world will perform better in decision-making and management due to the continuous updates of information. However, this big move towards computerization is based solely on engineering processes and mathematical modelling, leaving behind the human based inputs. The automation of the industrial process and decision making proved its efficiency when dealing with problems based on pure quantitative criteria. However, the human factors and in decision making are essential to evaluate the qualitative criteria. Predominantly, industrial decision making is always related to the satisfaction of the customer and the quality of developed products. These characteristics are vastly based on emotional maturity and psychological preferences, thus the importance of the evaluation of the emotional intelligence of the decision maker to ensure his or her ability to provide an optimal input during the decision process. Therefore, we focus in this study on the analysis of the impact of emotional intelligence on multicriteria decision making. A detailed presentation of the different tools of testing and assessment is provided. A proposal of an automated application to measure the emotional intelligence of the decision makers is discussed for future implementation using domain-specific languages. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={An increase in population expansion, urban sprawling environment, and climate change has resulted in increased food demand, water scarcity, environmental pollution, and mismanagement of water resources. Groundwater, i.e., one of the most precious and mined natural resources is used to address a variety of environmental demands. Among all, irrigation is one of the leading consumers of groundwater. Various natural heterogeneities and anthropogenic activities have impacted the groundwater quality. As a result, monitoring groundwater quality and determining its suitability are critical for the sustainable long-term management of groundwater resources. In this study, groundwater samples from 35 different sampling stations were collected and tested for various parameters associated with irrigation water quality. Hybrid MCDM (fuzzy-AHP) method was used to determine the groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes. The suitability map obtained using spatial overlay analysis was classified into low, moderate, and high irrigation water suitability zones. Along with suitability analysis, various regression-based machine learning models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) were used and compared to predict irrigation water suitability. Results depicted that the ANN model with the highest R2 value of 0.990 and RMSE value near to zero (0) has outperformed all other models. The present methodology could be found useful to predict irrigation water suitability in the region where regular sampling and analysis are quite challenging. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of ad-hoc wireless technology amidst the huge demands of high data-rates, the simultaneous optimization of overall networking throughput and utility-proportional resource allocation is of utmost significance. The design of infrastructure-less ad-hoc wireless network with highly dynamic operating conditions can be intelligently modeled by using the artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning techniques. In this work, we employ the meta-heuristic computational method of genetic algorithm for multi-criterion optimization of sigmoidal utility maximization and throughput efficiency. The iterative implementation of the evolutionary genetic algorithm is effectively enforced by considering the comprehensive application of eight disparate combinations of individual creation, selection, mutation and crossover operations. Through the simulation experiments, the impact of execution of these feasible composite models on the derived two-dimensional Pareto-optimal frontier, the criteria satisfaction ratio and the average spread of individual solutions is extensively investigated. Furthermore, these diverse genetic operations for retrieving the optimal solution to the proposed problem formulation are compared in terms of the estimated precision and time complexity metrics. Finally, the efficacy of our optimization model is significantly compared with the previous works in terms of achievable throughput. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

In fact, the weak cross-domain generalizability and 'Black-box' nature remain unsolved. Hence, we propose a novel framework, multiobjective evolution enhanced collaborative health monitoring and prognostics (MEeCHMPs), in which multiple relevant objectives are optimized via evolutionary approaches to construct health indicators for monitoring and prognosis of equipment health conditions. Specifically, we quantify prior degradation knowledge and domain discrepancy into an unsupervised multicriteria decision-making problem and combine various degradation features so that the Pareto dominance should be maintained. Furthermore, the explainable prognostics model is developed to solve a supervised multicriteria decision-making problem leading to symbolic life expressions, which are accurate and interpretable. Finally, MEeCHMP is applied to bearing life testes involving three-axis acceleration signals to demonstrate its performance in a real case. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Though many ontologies have a huge number of classes, one cannot find a good number of object properties connecting the classes in most of the cases. Adding object properties makes an ontology richer and more applicable for tasks such as Question Answering. In this context, determining the pair of classes that are most likely to have object properties between them becomes very important. We address the above question in this paper. We propose a simple yet powerful framework based on the popular multi-criteria decision making algorithm TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), for identifying relation-gaps. In order to identify such relation-gaps (i.e class-pairs) the proposed system utilizes a mix of criteria derived from the ontology itself and from external sources such as Wikipedia text corpora. Our experimental results show that by means of these carefully chosen criteria and their corresponding weights, the proposed system yields promising results with respect to the precision of the relation-gaps identified. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={This paper aims to understand the impact of big data analytics on the retail supply chain. For doing so, we set our context to select the best big data practices amongst the available alternatives based on retail supply chain performance. We have applied TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multi-criteria Decision Making) for the selection of the best big data analytics tools among the identified nine practices (data science, neural networks, enterprise resource planning, cloud computing, machine learning, data mining, RFID, Blockchain and IoT and Business intelligence) based on seven supply chain performance criteria (supplier integration, customer integration, cost, capacity utilization, flexibility, demand management, and time and value). One of the intriguing understandings from this paper is that most of the retail firms are in a dilemma between customer loyalty and cost while implementing the big data practices in their organization. This study analyses the dominance of the big data practices at the retail supply chain level. This helps the newly emerging retail firms in evaluating the best big data practice based on the importance and dominance of supply chain performance measures. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={This study develops an Adaboost-GIS model for flood susceptibility mapping and evaluates its relative performance by undertaking a comparative assessment of the machine learning model with Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and soft computing models integrated with GIS. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Analytic Network Process (ANP), Fuzzy-AHP, Fuzzy-ANP and AdaBoost machine learning models were developed and integrated with GIS to classify the susceptibility of the study area. Out of 70 sample validation locations, Adaboost’s performance was the best with a 95.72% similarity match with very high and high susceptibility locations followed by F-ANP, ANP, F-AHP and AHP with 95.65%, 92.75%, 81.42% and 77.14% similarity matches, respectively. It also had the highest AUC (0.864). Thus, the Adaboost machine learning, Fuzzy computing and conventional MCDM models can be adopted by stakeholders for accurately assessing flood susceptibility, thereby fostering safe and resilient cities. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are being increasingly deployed throughout the globe as a means to streamline monitoring, inspection, mapping, and logistic routines. When dispatched on autonomous missions, drones require an intelligent decision-making system for trajectory planning and tour optimization. Given the limited capacity of their onboard batteries, a key design challenge is to ensure the underlying algorithms can efficiently optimize the mission objectives along with recharging operations during long-haul flights. With this in view, the present work undertakes a comprehensive study on automated tour management systems for an energy-constrained drone: (1) We construct a machine learning model that estimates the energy expenditure of typical multi-rotor drones while accounting for real-world aspects and extrinsic meteorological factors. (2) Leveraging this model, the joint program of flight mission planning and recharging optimization is formulated as a multi-criteria Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP), wherein a drone seeks for the time-optimal energy-feasible tour that visits all the target sites and refuels whenever necessary. (3) We devise an efficient approximation algorithm with provable worst-case performance guarantees and implement it in a drone management system, which supports real-time flight path tracking and re-computation in dynamic environments. (4) The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach are validated through extensive numerical simulations as well as real-world experiments. Author},

abstract={Chromosomal diseases diagnostics is based on identifying chromosomes and detecting abnormalities in them. It is a sophisticated procedure that is performed manually or partially automated, therefore is prone to human error. Automation of such diagnostics is a complex multistage task that presents many challenges. One of such challenges is chromosome feature extraction and classification. Categorizing chromosomes is necessary for determining a diagnosis. This problem has been previously covered by research papers, but there is no complete solution by now. Moreover, the vast majority of proposals rely on Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Networks (NN). Usage of ML-powered solutions may pose a problem due to difficulty of dataset collection - medical data may be diverse, heterogeneous and hard to collect because of its sensitive nature. Given paper presents a proposal of chromosome feature extraction and categorization without NN. It uses Computer Vision (CV) techniques for chromosome feature extraction: medial axis is extracted from a chromosome to identify its direction, and than chromosome bands (colored segments that make up distinct chromosome pattern) are identified along the axis. Having transformed chromosome image into a discrete piece of data, it is passed to a proposed multiple-criteria decision-making algorithm. This algorithm is designed to categorize chromosomes without learning dataset, instead making use of ideogram (schematic reference chromosome) data. The algorithm is focused on processing a chromosome as a set of segments, where each segment can be recognized by a special predicate. A predefined combination of such predicates should allow recognizing chromosome type. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to assist higher education institutions (HEIs) in their decision-making process to define initiatives and foster research projects contributing to sustainable development (SD) and minimizing the deficits found in the municipalities. Design/methodology/approach: A documental analysis was performed to select HEIs and Brazilian regional development indicators. Then, the assessment of the sustainable and institutional performance of Brazilian municipalities that have HEIs consisted of three parts: clustering with an unsupervised machine learning model, ranking with a hybrid multi-criteria decision making method and visualization of sustainability performance with the dashboard. Findings: The critical analysis of institutional and sustainability indicators contributes to a more active role of HEIs in matters of social responsibility, with a more holistic view of the performance and quality of municipal education. Furthermore, this critical analysis creates a scenario where HEIs can develop public policy proposals in partnership with the government to mitigate the main issues identified. Social implications: With this study, HEIs will be able to direct their actions to minimize the deficits found in the municipalities, consolidating their social responsibility. Originality/value: This study proposes a new decision-support tool with a dashboard of indicators so that HEIs can foster research projects with a focus on regional SD. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Problem statement: Currently, the Machine Learning Control (MLC) methodology is rapidly developing, using machine learning methods to solve problems of complex dynamic systems control. One of the main paradigms of MLC is the technology of neuroevolutionary synthesis of control and decision-making models, which is considered as a promising means of on-board implementation of intelligent control algorithms for autonomous systems under environmental uncertainty. At the same time, when using the neuroevolutionary approach to solve multi-criteria control problems for dynamic systems under conflict, the following problems arise. First, the problem of training an artificial neural network (ANN) should be formalized in the form of a multi-criteria optimization problem under uncertainty (MOU), for the solution of which it is necessary to use approaches that generalize the well-known principle of guaranteed result of Hermeyer Yu., and take into account the conflict nature of the MOU problem. Secondly, when forming models of dynamic systems neuro-control, the training set has a complex structure and can include components that are themselves sets represented in a continuous form. The need to solve these problems determines the high computational complexity of the task of training the ANN and the need to develop a more efficient computing technology compatible with promising computing architectures, coevolutionary models and methods of distributed computing. Purpose of research: Development, software implementation based on distributed computing and research of the effectiveness of hierarchical population game models of coevolutionary algorithms for solving the ANN training problem, formalized as a MOU problem. Results: A methodics of ANN training based on hierarchical population game models of coevolutionary algorithms for solving the MOU problem using the principles of vector minimax and vector minimax risk is developed. Practical significance: The developed hierarchical population-based game models of coevolutionary training algorithms for ANN can be used in the design of SEMS neural control systems under conflict and environmental uncertainty. The problem of multi-criteria synthesis of an ANN, which is an integral part of a hierarchical neural network ensemble and implements algorithms for optimal robust neurostabilization of an unmanned aerial vehicle in a wide range of changes in environmental conditions, is solved. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Efficient evaluation for machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for federated learning (FL) in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) environment falls under the standardisation and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Thus, this study is developing an MCDM framework for standardising and benchmarking the ML-based IDSs used in the FL architecture of IoMT applications. In the methodology, firstly, the evaluation criteria of ML-based IDSs are standardised using the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). Secondly, the evaluation decision matrix (DM) is formulated based on the intersection of standardised evaluation criteria and a list of ML-based IDSs. Such formulation is achieved using a dataset with 125,973 records, and each record comprises 41 features. Thirdly, the integration of MCDM methods is formulated to determine the importance weights of the main and sub standardised security and performance criteria, followed by benchmarking and selecting the optimal ML-based IDSs. In this phase, the Borda voting method is used to unify the different ranks and perform a group benchmarking context. The following results are confirmed. (1) Using FDM, 17 out of 20 evaluation criteria (14 for security and 3 for performance) reach the consensus of experts. (2) The area under curve criterion has the lowest set of weights, whilst the CPU time criterion has the highest one. (3) VIKOR group ranking shows that the BayesNet is a best classifier, whilst SVM is the last choice. For evaluation, three assessments, namely, systematic ranking, computational cost and comparative analysis, are used. IEEE},

abstract={Deep Learning methods are well-known for their abilities, but their interpretability keeps them out of high-stakes situations. This difficulty is addressed by recent model-agnostic methods that provide explanations after the training process. As a result, the current guidelines’ requirement for “interpretability from the start” is not met. As a result, such methods are only useful as a sanity check after the model has been trained. In an abstract scenario, “interpretability from the start” implies imposing a set of soft constraints on the model’s behavior by infusing knowledge and eliminating any biases. By inserting knowledge into the objective function, we present a Multicriteria technique that allows us to control the feature effects on the model’s output. To accommodate for more complex effects and local lack of information, we enhance the method by integrating particular knowledge functions. As a result, a Deep Learning training process that is both interpretable and compliant with modern legislation has been developed. Our technique develops performant yet robust models capable of overcoming biases resulting from data scarcity, according to a practical empirical example based on credit risk. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Through improved nutrient management, sustainability of cereal production can be achieved by improving crop yield and economic indicators with reduced environmental footprints and energy use. The objectives of this study were to compare the crop yield and economics, and energy and environment related indicators as the measures of sustainability across three nutrient management practices in three major cereals of South Asia. Nutrient Expert (NE) based fertilizer recommendation, government recommendation (GR), and farmers' nutrient management practice (FP) were evaluated in 600 on-farm trials in two eastern Terai districts of Nepal during 2014–2016. The machine learning (Random Forest) approach was used to identify major indicators to predict grain yield variability. The NE-based recommendation had the highest and FP had the lowest grain yield and gross return in all cereals. Farmer's practice had the highest probability of increasing energy-use efficiency (EUE) followed by NE in all cereals. NE had the lowest yield-scaled greenhouse gas emission (greenhouse gas emission intensity; GHGI) in rice and intermediate in maize and wheat compared with GR or FP. Farmers' practice had consistently the highest GHGI in rice and maize while GR had the highest GHGI in wheat. Except for rice in FP, specific energy (SE) followed by EUE were the major predictors of grain yield of all crops in all nutrient management practices. These findings suggest an opportunity for increasing productivity and profitability with lowered GHGI of the major cereals with NE-based fertilizer recommendation and potential for its out-scaling in Nepal and the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Geothermal prospectivity mapping using multiple-criteria decision analysis is well-documented in the scientific literature. However, most previous works suffer from two drawbacks: no consideration of the geology for defining the weights of the decision criteria, and no metrics of reliability for the prospectivity prediction. In this work, we introduce a method that overcomes these drawbacks and extends on a large scale the mapping provided manually by the experts. The method is based on (i) automatic regressions of both heat flow and thermal gradient maps using a multi-model approach, (ii) introduction of geology-dependent criteria weights for the decision analysis, and (iii) combination of multiple decision maps to obtain a more robust prospectivity mapping and a quantification of the reliability of the prediction. Applied to geothermal data from British Columbia, the method appears to produce prospectivity maps with higher spatial resolution than conventional ones. Besides, it substantially attenuates the footprint of data acquisition and facilitates the identification of geographical zones where the prediction is the most uncertain, thus where a human subjective interpretation would have the most added value. The proposed workflow is easily transposable to any context of subsurface exploration or exploitation, for instance in the petroleum, mining, or hydrogeological industries. © 2022 2nd EAGE Digitalization Conference and Exhibition.

abstract={How to choose the appropriate model to predict the time series is one of the most prominent activities of temporal data analysis. Empirical evidence is often adopted to select the most suitable model since there is no unified standard for matching data and models. Data characteristics affect model performance to a certain extent and maybe where the factors that determine the balance between prediction accuracy and model complexity are. In this article, Multi-Criteria Performance Measure method considering Mean of Absolute Value of the Residual Autocorrelation was adopted to address this problem. Case studies apply Time-Series Analysis decomposing datasets into trend, seasonality and residue and summarize the limitations and recommendations from the stochasticity of the residue. The results show that the statistical models perform best for datasets with low stochasticity, deep learning models specialize in forecasting fluctuant and long-term time series data, machine learning models could be candidates for datasets that possess numerical characters between the previous two categories. Conclusions could provide suggestions in selecting appropriate models and guide the research community in focusing the effort on more feasible or promising directions. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine learning and optimisation of wire electro-discharge machining process are prevalent in single-material systems, but rare in multi-material systems, particularly in stainless steel, due to the large number of variables affecting responses. In the available literature, the design of such a machine learning approach is likewise not thoroughly described. The current study was conducted to identify the efficient multi-material model incorporating six process variables and seven compositional variables using several methods, such as response surface methodology, single-output multi-layer (SOML), and multi-output multi-layer (MOML) neural networks, to understand the response behaviours such as material removal rate, kerf width, over cut, and surface roughness (Ra) of SS304 and SS316 materials. Both SOML and MOML models have been found to be capable of predicting responses with good accuracy; however, SOML models are slightly more accurate. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was used in conjunction with the SOML model, where the predicted responses of SOML models were used directly as inputs for process variable optimisation. The TOPSIS-generated optimum process variables for the multi-material system were validated, with each response having a prediction error of less than 10%. © 2022, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

abstract={Deep learning (DL) approaches based on convolutional encoder-decoder networks have shown promising results in bitemporal change detection. However, their performance is limited by insufficient contextual information aggregation because they cannot fully capture the implicit contextual dependency relationships among feature maps at different levels. Moreover, harvesting long-range contextual information typically incurs high computational complexity. To circumvent these challenges, we propose multilevel deformable attention-aggregated networks (MLDANets) to effectively learn long-range dependencies across multiple levels of bitemporal convolutional features for multiscale context aggregation. Specifically, a multilevel change-aware deformable attention (MCDA) module consisting of linear projections with learnable parameters is built based on multihead self-attention (SA) with a deformable sampling strategy. It is applied in the skip connections of an encoder-decoder network taking a bitemporal deep feature hypersequence (BDFH) as input. MCDA can progressively address a set of informative sampling locations in multilevel feature maps for each query element in the BDFH. Simultaneously, MCDA learns to characterize beneficial information from different spatial and feature subspaces of BDFH using multiple attention heads for change perception. As a result, contextual dependencies across multiple levels of bitemporal feature maps can be adaptively aggregated via attention weights to generate multilevel discriminative change-aware representations. Experiments on very-high-resolution (VHR) datasets verify that MLDANets outperform state-of-the-art change detection approaches with dramatically faster training convergence and high computational efficiency. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine learning is a technique that is widely employed in both the academic and industrial sectors all over the world. Machine learning algorithms that are intuitive can analyse risks and respond swiftly to breaches and security issues. It is crucial in offering a proactive security system in the field of cybersecurity. In real time, cybersecurity protects information, information systems, and networks from intruders. In the recent decade, several assessments on security and privacy estimates have noted a rapid growth in both the incidence and quantity of cybersecurity breaches. At an increasing rate, intruders are breaching information security. Anomaly detection, software vulnerability diagnosis, phishing page identification, denial of service assaults, and malware identification are the foremost cyber-security concerns that require efficient clarifications. Practitioners have tried a variety of approaches to address the present cybersecurity obstacles and concerns. In a similar vein, the goal of this research is to assess the idealness of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems under fuzzy conditions using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)-based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal-Solutions (TOPSIS). Fuzzy sets are ideal for dealing with decision-making scenarios in which experts are unsure of the best course of action. The projected work would support practitioners in identifying, prioritising, and selecting cybersecurityrelated attributes for intrusion detection systems, allowing them to design more optimal and effective intrusion detection systems. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

abstract={Cloud computing can be considered a revolutionizing invention of decay.

Due to the availability of numerous CSPs with different offerings, it becomes complicated for the user to pick the right services. In the presented paper, a supervised learning-based model based on Random Forest Regressor is proposed. The proposed model has been trained for Multi Criteria Decision Making Methods (MCDM) methods such as Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), and Weighted Sum Method (WSM).

This paper provides an approach of categorising employees to quantify the importance of the employees using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, i.e., criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) to assign relative weights to employee accomplishments and fuzzy Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution (MARCOS) method to divide employees into three categories. Followed by executing churn analysis of each category of employees and original dataset using machine learning algorithms to investigate the importance of employee categorisation. CatBoost, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGradient Boost algorithms have been used to analyse the categorised and non-categorised dataset on the accuracy, precision, recall and Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to derive the best suitable algorithm for the used dataset. CatBoost algorithm showed the best results regarding performance measurements for categorised employees are better than all employee datasets. © 2022, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Data mining studies have been frequently included in the literature recently. Data mining can be applied in every field, especially in banking, marketing, customer relationship management, investment and portfolio management. In the literature, the problem of personnel selection has been examined with the help of multi-criteria decision-making techniques. In this study, it has been aimed to apply data mining techniques in the field of human resources where relatively little has been used. The features of a large-scale construction company have been determined according to the competencies specified in the information technologies department announcement. The candidates were ranked according to these attributes. While ranking, accuracy values have been compared by using basic algorithms of data mining techniques. While applying the process steps, the necessary data pre-processing techniques have been applied to candidates who entered incomplete or incorrect information during the application process. Basically, the decision trees algorithm gave the highest accuracy. Also, random forest, adaboost, gradient boosting, and xgboost algorithms have been tried. In addition, it has found the attributes that should be looked at first in the application features. The high number of data enabled machine learning to learn information more easily and to weigh the existing criteria easily. With this study, it has been aimed to obtain a more objective result by weighting with machine learning algorithms instead of weighting the personnel selection problem with multi-criteria decision-making methodology. In addition, it is an extremely difficult process to interview candidates for recruitment under the current Covid-19 pandemic conditions that the whole world and our country are struggling with. Online conversations take a lot of time. With this study, it has been aimed to provide optimization by automating the process by weighting the features related to the existing data in the process. The study has been done in the WEKA and Python program. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Assessment of the thermal bioclimatic environmental changes is important to understand ongoing climate change implications on agriculture, ecology, and human health. This is particularly important for the climatologically diverse transboundary Amy Darya River basin, a major source of water and livelihood for millions in Central Asia. However, the absence of longer period observed temperature data is a major obstacle for such analysis. This study employed a novel approach by integrating compromise programming and multicriteria group decision–making methods to evaluate the efficiency of four global gridded temperature datasets based on observation data at 44 stations. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing the results obtained using symmetrical uncertainty, a machine learning similarity assessment method. The most reliable gridded data was used to assess the spatial distribution of global warming-induced unidirectional trends in thermal bioclimatic indicators (TBI) using a modified Mann–Kendall test. Ranking of the products revealed Climate Prediction Center (CPC) temperature as most efficient in reconstruction observed temperature, followed by TerraClimate and Climate Research Unit. The ranking of the product was consistent with that obtained using SU. Assessment of TBI trends using CPC data revealed an increase in the Tmin in the coldest month over the whole basin at a rate of 0.03–0.08 °C per decade, except in the east. Besides, an increase in diurnal temperature range and isothermally increased in the east up to 0.2 °C and 0.6% per decade, respectively. The results revealed negative implications of thermal bioclimatic change on water, ecology, and public health in the eastern mountainous region and positive impacts on vegetation in the west and northwest. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has emerged in many aspects of life, such as transportation, healthcare, and even education. IoT technology incorporates several tasks to achieve the goals for which it was developed through smart services. These services are intelligent activities that allow devices to interact with the physical world to provide suitable services to users anytime and anywhere. However, the remarkable advancement of this technology has increased the number and the mechanisms of attacks. Attackers often take advantage of the IoTs’ heterogeneity to cause trust problems and manipulate the behavior to delude devices’ reliability and the service provided through it. Consequently, trust is one of the security challenges that threatens IoT smart services. Trust management techniques have been widely used to identify untrusted behavior and isolate untrusted objects over the past few years. However, these techniques still have many limitations like ineffectiveness when dealing with a large amount of data and continuously changing behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for trust management in IoT devices and services based on the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The SMART is used for calculating the trust value, while LSTM is used for identifying changes in the behavior based on the trust threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using accuracy, loss rate, precision, recall, and F-measure on different data samples with different sizes. Comparisons with existing deep learning and machine learning models show superior performance with a different number of iterations. With 100 iterations, the proposed model achieved 99.87% and 99.76% of accuracy and F-measure, respectively. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, is the fastest-growing research trend in educational fields. Machine learning shows an impressive performance in many prediction models, including psychosocial education. The capability of machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large datasets encourages researchers to invent data with high-dimensional features. In contrast, not all features are needed by machine learning, and in many cases, high-dimensional features decrease the performance of machine learning. The feature selection method is one of the appropriate approaches to reducing the features to ensure machine learning works efficiently. Various selection methods have been proposed, but research to determine the essential subset feature in psychosocial education has not been established thus far. This research investigated and proposed methods to determine the best feature selection method in the domain of psychosocial education. We used a multi-criteria decision system (MCDM) approach with Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) to rank seven feature selection methods. The proposed model evaluated the best feature selection method using nine criteria from the performance metrics provided by machine learning. The experimental results showed that the ARAS is promising for evaluating and recommending the best feature selection method for psychosocial education data using the teacher’s psychosocial risk levels dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The annual average economic losses due to various natural disasters are increasing exponentially across the globe and have reached a mark of US$239.2 billion per year between the period 2000–2019. In India, due to flood hazards, approximately 6.5 million people were affected and the total economic damages were approximately US$3 billion per year between 1990 and 2019. This study proposes to compare and evaluate the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Shannon's Entropy (SE), and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods in the preparation of flood susceptibility mapping and assess their contextual suitability. The study has been carried out in coastal districts of West Bengal, India namely, South 24 Parganas and East Midnapur. Nine flood conditioning factors were identified and used as input parameters for the study. Each flood susceptibility map was subdivided into four categories where 27.29% of the study area were categorized as highly susceptible, while 39.45% of area were categorized as moderately susceptible to flood hazards. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Seed Cell Area Index (SCAI) were applied for accuracy assessment and validation of the selected models. AUC values for ROC curves showed that the performance of the SVM model is better than that of the AHP and SE methods. Moreover, Hot Spots analyses for identification of high flood susceptible clusters revealed that the SVM model was far superior when compared to the other two models. The factors selected for assessment of flood susceptibility in AHP and SE models could not respond to the changing scale of analyses and hence produced significant erroneous outcomes. Hence, the SVM model evolved as the most versatile method in this comparison. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The increasing quantity and variety of organic contaminants discharged into surface and groundwater increase the necessity of additional and suitable water treatment methods, which can be incorporated into existing wastewater treatment plants. The huge variety of micropollutants and local variability of the composition of the organic load or matrix effects paired with multiple possible degradation processes lead to the requirement of a recommendation tool for the best possible water treatment method under given local conditions. Due to the diversity of physicochemical properties of micropollutants, such predictions are challenging. In this study, a quantitative correlation between the structural properties of certain micropollutants and their degradability using high-frequency sonolysis has been investigated. Therefore, Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) has been applied on a set of phenol derivates. To obtain the kinetic data, all experiments have been conducted in standardized, constant conditions for all 32 investigated phenol derivates. QSPR modelling was then executed using the software PaDEL for descriptor calculation and the software QSARINS for the overall modelling process including genetic algorithm (GA) and multiple linear regression (MLR). The final model consisting of 5 molecular descriptors was selected using a multi-criteria decision-making method based on extensive statistical parameters. The predictive power and robustness of the model was evaluated by means of internal cross validation and external validation using an independent validation set. The final selected model showed very good values for regression abilities, predictive power as well as stability (R2adj = 0.9455, CCCtr = 0.9777, Q2loo = 0.9285, CCCext = 0.9797 and Q2ext-F1 = 0.9711). The applicability domain of the QSPR model was defined based on the Williams plot and Insubria plot. The five OECD principles for the application of QSPR/QSAR modelling in industry and regulation were fulfilled in the whole process to the best of our knowledge, including the collection of the underlying experimental data as well as the entire modelling process. The final QSPR model included the molecular polarity and occurrence of hydrogen bonds as major influences on the reaction rate constants in accordance with previous studies. Nevertheless, potential biases in the selection of these descriptors due to the small size of the dataset were highlighted. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={In several earlier studies, machine learning (ML) has been widely used for building insider threat detection systems. However, the selection of the most appropriate ML classification model for insider threats detection remains a challenge. Despite the prominence of ML in the domain of insider threat detection, none of the previous works have utilized ML techniques for building a hybrid solution that can take advantage of the misuse and anomaly insider threat detection. In this study, a new multilayer framework has been proposed for insider threat detection. The first layer of the framework is used for selecting the best insider threat detection classification model among many based on the multi-criteria decision making techniques. The selection procedure has been developed based on the integration of the entropy-VIKOR methods. For the second layer, a hybrid insider threat detection method has been proposed, where the Misuse Insider Threat Detection (MITD) model has been created using the random forest algorithm. Subsequently, using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, an anomaly insider threat detection algorithm has been developed. The proposed multilayer framework for insider threat detection has been evaluated by using the CERT r4.2 dataset. Results of the experiment demonstrate that the validity of the results produced by the selection framework is proven by the validation procedure obtained from previous research. The proposed hybrid detection method is observed to exhibit an overall accuracy of 99% and a false positive rate of 0.29% for known insider threats, whereas it exhibits 97% accuracy and 2.88% false-positive rate for unknown insider threats. © 2021},

abstract={Poultry is the world’s most widespread bird species and the major contributor to ammonia and greenhouse gases emission. In order to improve poultry, productivity enterprises used new technological innovations to manage and monitor poultry farms. The objective of the study is to analyse the existing smart poultry management systems that allow taking a decision for the most appropriate feeding process and the lowest level of CO2 and NH3 emission. A smart poultry management system is a crucial component of modern poultry farm. The research directions and technologies related to smart poultry management systems are analysed, which are used for poultry productivity, health and welfare prediction. There is not much research on the use of a multi-criteria decision model in poultry farming, where productivity and welfare improvement and greenhouse gases emission reduction are taking into account at the same time. The necessary challenges of the smart platform implementation are designed for the improvement of poultry productivity and reduction of GHG emissions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In today’s time, software quality assurance is the most essential and costly set of activities during software development in the information technology (IT) industries. Finding defects in system modules has always been one of the most relevant problems in software engineering, leading to increased costs and reduced confidence in the product, resulting in dissatisfaction with customer requirements. Therefore, to provide and deliver an efficient software product with as few defects as possible on time and of good quality, it is necessary to use machine learning techniques and models, such as supervised learning to accurately classify and predict defects in each of the software development life cycle (SDLC) phases before delivering a software product to the customer. The main objective is to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models in software defect prediction applied to 4 NASA datasets, such as CM1, JM1, KC1, and PC1, then de-terminate and select the best performing model using the MCDM: VIKOR multi-criteria decision-making method. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The thermochemical processes such as gasification and co-gasification of biomass and coal are promising route for producing hydrogen-rich syngas. However, the process is characterized with complex reactions that pose a tremendous challenge in terms of controlling the process variables. This challenge can be overcome using appropriate machine learning algorithm to model the nonlinear complex relationship between the predictors and the targeted response. Hence, this study aimed to employ various machine learning algorithms such as regression models, support vector machine regression (SVM), gaussian processing regression (GPR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for modeling hydrogen-rich syngas production by gasification and co-gasification of biomass and coal. A total of 12 machine learning algorithms which comprises the regression models, SVM, GPR, and ANN were configured, trained using 124 datasets. The performances of the algorithms were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). In all cases, the ANN algorithms offer superior performances and displayed robust predictions of the hydrogen-rich syngas from the co-gasification processes. The R2 of both the Levenberg-Marquardt- and Bayesian Regularization-trained ANN obtained from the prediction of the hydrogen-rich syngas was found to be within 0.857–0.998 with low prediction errors. The sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of the process parameters on the model output revealed that all the parameters showed a varying level of influence. In most of the processes, the gasification temperature was found to have the most significant influence on the model output. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Municipal solid waste is typically managed in developing countries through various disposal methods, such as sanitary landfills or dumpsites. Alternatively, waste to energy (WTE) systems have been recently adopted to provide sustainable waste management and diversify the energy mix. The abundance of remotely sensed datasets and derivatives, along with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, can offer an effective solution for WTE site selection. In this study, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based framework supported by multiple machine learning algorithms (gradient boosted tree (GBT), decision tree (DT), and support vector machines (SVMs)) was established to explore the optimum location for WTE facilities. Various social, legal, environmental, economic, morphological, and land cover parameters were considered under 11 thematic geospatial raster layers. The proposed framework was applied to the 1.5-million-capita city of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. A novel approach was developed to incorporate Gaussian dispersion modeling for the expected air pollution emissions from a WTE facility. The results showed that the accuracy performance sequence of the algorithms was 94.6, 93.9, and 91.8% for GBT, DT, and SVM, respectively. It was found that the distance from existing landfills had the most critical impact on the optimum location of the WTE facility, followed by the distance from coastline and elevation. The AHP consistency check revealed an acceptable overall criteria consistency index and the ratio of 0.0344 and 0.019, respectively. The results showed that 16.6% of Sharjah was considered extremely highly suitable areas. This research supports decision-makers in developing local guidelines for siting WTE facilities and determining the most suitable locations for such projects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution for building and promoting more resilient supply chains. However, the literature is highly dispersed regarding the application of AI in supply-chain management. The literature to date lacks a decision-making framework for identifying and applying powerful AI techniques to build supply-chain resilience (SCRes), curbing advances in research and practice on this interesting interface. In this paper, we propose an integrated Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique powered by AI-based algorithms such as Fuzzy systems, Wavelet Neural Networks (WNN) and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) to identify patterns in AI techniques for developing different SCRes strategies. The analysis was informed by data collected from 479 manufacturing companies to determine the most significant AI applications used for SCRes. The findings show that fuzzy logic programming, machine learning big data, and agent-based systems are the most promising techniques used to promote SCRes strategies. The study findings support decision-makers by providing an integrated decision-making framework to guide practitioners in AI deployment for building SCRes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In furtherance of emerging research within smart production planning and control (PPC), this paper prescribes a methodology for the design and development of a smart PPC system. A smart PPC system uses emerging technologies such as the internet of things, big-data analytics tools and machine learning running on the cloud or on edge devices to enhance performance of PPC processes. It achieves this by using a wider range of data sources from the production system, capturing and utilizing the experience of production planners, using analytics and machine learning to harness insights from the data and allowing dynamic and near real-time action to the continuously changing production system. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a case study in a sweets and snacks manufacturing company, to highlight the key considerations and challenges production managers might face during its application. The case further demonstrates considerations for scalability and flexibility via a loosely coupled, service-oriented architecture and the selection of fitting algorithms respectively to address a business requirement for a short-term, multi-criteria and event-driven production planning and control solution. Finally, the paper further discusses the challenges of PPC in smart manufacturing and the importance of fitting smart technologies to planning environment characteristics. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Modelling infectious diseases is a complex and multi-disciplinary problem that necessitates the combined use of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and machine learning (ML) in a spatial framework. This research attempts to demonstrate the extensive applications of MCDA in the field of public health and to illustrate its utility with the combined use of spatial models and machine learning. The study investigates the risk factors for communicable diseases with a focus on vector-borne infectious diseases, such as West Nile Virus (WNV), malaria, dengue, etc. It aims to quantify vector-borne disease risk by examining the geographic contextual effects of socio-economic, climatic, and environmental factors using the objective-weighting technique adopted from MCDA and machine learning in a geographic information systems (GIS) framework. The authors attempted to minimize subjective bias from the decision space by utilizing an objective-weighted technique to quantify the risk. The study adopted Shannon's entropy to derive weights for each factor and its classes. The derived weighted layers are fed to an artificial neural network to obtain a final map of risk susceptibility. This final risk map allows policymakers to examine vulnerable areas and identify the factors pivotal to the contribution of risk. Findings show the traffic volume as the most influential variable, and terrain slope as the least one in the disease spread for the study area. The risk appears to be concentrated and distributed along vegetation, wetlands, and around water bodies. The results produced by ensemble learning show great promise with more than 94% accuracy. The accuracy of the results was determined by the confusion matrix and the kappa index of agreement (KIA). The vector control programmes need to adapt to better manage the dynamic changes in patterns involving vector-borne infectious diseases. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Sustainable tourism is an emerging trend around the world. Eco-friendly (green) hotels are environmentally friendly properties that are becoming more popular among green travellers. Electronic Word-of-Mouth (e-WOM) is a method of communicating with customers to share their experiences and is a powerful marketing tool for hotel marketing. This paper investigates the role of online reviews of eco-friendly hotels for preference learning using multi-criteria decision-making and machine learning techniques. We develop a new method using multi-criteria decision making, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used as an unsupervised learning technique to cluster travellers’ online reviews. We use the Higher-Order Singular-Value Decomposition technique along with a similarity measure to find the most similar customers based on their preference. To predict travellers’ preference for eco-friendly hotels, we employ a neuro-fuzzy system, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System, as a supervised learning technique. To select the most important criteria, we use the entropy-weight approach in each segment. Several experiments were performed on the collected data from the Czech Republic's eco-friendly hotels on the TripAdvisor platform. The results demonstrated that the hybrid approach is effective for customers’ segmentation, and preference learning and prediction in eco-friendly hotels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Feature selection in real-world data mining problems is essential to make the learning task efficient and more accurate. Identifying the best feature selection algorithm, among the many available, is a complex activity that still relies heavily on human experts or some random trial-and-error procedure. Thus, the automated machine learning community has taken some steps towards the automation of this process. In this paper, we address the metalearning challenge of recommending feature selection algorithms by proposing a novel meta-feature engineering model. Our model considers a broad collection of meta-features that enable the study of the relationship between the dataset properties and the feature selection algorithm performance in terms of several criteria. We arrange the input meta-features into eight categories: (i) simple, (ii) statistical, (iii) information-theoretical, (iv) complexity, (v) landmarking, (vi) based on symbolic models, (vii) based on images, and (viii) based on complex networks (graphs). The target meta-features emerge from a multi-criteria performance measure, based on five individual performance indexes, that assesses feature selection methods grounded in information, distance, dependence, consistency, and precision measures. We evaluate our proposal using a recently developed framework that extracts the input meta-features from 213 benchmark datasets, and ranks the assessed feature selection algorithms, to fill in the target meta-features in meta-bases. This evaluation uses five state-of-the-art classification methods to induce recommendation models from meta-bases: C4.5, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, and SVM. The results showed that it is possible to reach an average accuracy of up to 90% applying our meta-feature engineering model. This work is the first to use an extensive empirical evaluation to provide a careful discussion of the strengths and limitations of more than 160 meta-features. These meta-features, while designed to aid the task of feature selection algorithm recommendation, can readily be employed in other metalearning scenarios. Therefore, we believe our findings are a valuable contribution to the fields of automated machine learning and data mining, as well as to the feature extraction and pattern recognition communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the era of big data, parallel Topk query processing under information retrieval has received increasing attention from both the industry and academia. This query handling allows users to retrieve the most useful data objects in a set of choices. This problem is compounded by the use of Topk in cases of multiple dimensions and extensive data analytics. In this article, we provide a novel parallel algorithm in a distributed recommender system based on the Apache Spark platform. The purpose of this approach was to implement the multicriteria decision aiding support and dominating query approach run by using matrix factorization and singular value decomposition (SVD)-based model as a sophisticated machine learning technique. Simultaneously, applying the resilient distributed datasets paradigm in cloud computing, which presents a favorable environment for big data management. Extensive experimental results in terms of accuracy, and scalability indicated the new algorithm's advantage compared to other Topk algorithms. Accordingly, our recommender system based on the conceived algorithm achieved high precision (62%-82%, depending on the data) to verify the profoundly positive effect of the use of the Spark framework and the SVD-based model while applying the commonly used evaluation metrics in the recommendation systems. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

Techniques such as expert judgement, incident analysis, geometric models, domain analysis and Bayesian Networks amongst many others have become dominant within both the literature and industry. On top of this, advances in machine learning algorithms and big data have opened opportunities for new methods which might overcome some limitations of conventional approaches. Yet, determining the suitability or validity of one technique over another is challenging as it requires a systematic multicriteria approach to compare the inputs, assumptions, methodologies and results of each method. Within this paper, such an approach is proposed and tested within an isolated waterway in order to justify the proposed advantages of a machine learning approach to maritime risk assessment and should serve as inspiration for future work. © 2021, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

abstract={Seagrass is a key factor of the nature-based solution to climate change impacts, however, this resource has been lost and degraded worldwide in both of area and habitats. Protection of extant seagrass often requires a zoning approach to fit the local conditions and to identify the spatial prioritization. In this study, we integrated the state-of-the-art machine learning model (CatBoost) and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery for mapping the extent of seagrass meadows, combined with the multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), fuzzy logic (Sigmoidal membership function), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique in a GIS database to score the ecological protection zoning of seagrass ecosystem in Lap An lagoon, Vietnam. Seagrass map retrieved from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery was used as the constrain factor, whilst salinity, water depth, substratum, and distance to aquaculture sites were conditioning factors. Our results presented accurate mapping of seagrass meadows in the study site (scores of overall accuracy, precision, and F1 are 0.93, 0.90 and 0.92, respectively) and indicated 22.05 ha (scores 0.66—0.99) in high, 18.63 ha (scores 0.33—0.66) in medium, and 10.80 ha (scores 0—0.33) in low priority of protection in the southern and the eastern southwest parts of the lagoon, and the areas closed to the aquaculture sites, respectively. Our novel integrated approach to map the priority zones is useful for sustainable protection and management of seagrass meadows and provides a framework to strengthen the application of remote sensing and GIS-based techniques for further conservation of seagrass globally. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract={Time series cross-validation is a technique to select forecasting models. Despite the sophistication of cross-validation over single test/training splits, traditional and independent metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), are commonly used to assess the model’s accuracy. However, what if decision-makers have different models fitting expectations to each moment of a time series? What if the precision of the forecasted values is also important? This is the case of predicting COVID-19 in Amapá, a Brazilian state in the Amazon rainforest. Due to the lack of hospital capacities, a model that promptly and precisely responds to notable ups and downs in the number of cases may be more desired than average models that only have good performances in more frequent and calm circumstances. In line with this, this paper proposes a hybridization of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy sets to create a similarity metric, the closeness coefficient (CC), that enables relative comparisons of forecasting models under heterogeneous fitting expectations and also considers volatility in the predictions. We present a case study using three parametric and three machine learning models commonly used to forecast COVID-19 numbers. The results indicate that the introduced fuzzy similarity metric is a more informative performance assessment metric, especially when using time series cross-validation. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The overrun of images and corpus spam on the web constitutes a threat to users producing more troubles, diminishing internet bandwidth, and increasing network overload. In this paper, we introduce a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for spam classification based on an analytic hierarchy process. The proposed approach permits the selection of the most optimal classifier among six machine learning algorithms according to a set of performance metrics. The ranking consistency of classifiers has been evaluated with a consistency ratio almost inferior to 0.1 on all dataset. The proposed framework can recommend top-K classifiers with high accuracy by using Euclidean distance on basic characteristics of test and train data that was already trained on a set of classifiers and fed into the MCDM framework. The experiment has been performed on eight publicly available datasets and tested on four datasets using only known features from the dataset and using Euclidean distance measure to identify from the most performant classifier algorithm. The followed methodology has accurately identified the most suited classifier on training datasets with average accuracy 95% for both images and corpus spam out and achieved 100% accuracy on a personalimageham+spamarchive_jml dataset that performs better than existing methods. We performed Friedman statistical test on the dataset that showed significance, then a post hoc Conover test performed on each data to make a pairwise comparison that demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach based AHP framework. The proposed approach outperforms existing research works in term of spam identification on both image and corpus spam data and was successful in recommending classifiers to unknown datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Selection of the best green technology for a given application is a multi-criterion decision analysis problem. The tradeoffs that need to be made among conflicting attributes of the alternatives are inherently subjective and require the use of interactive decision analysis tools. In this work, a machine-learning based methodology is developed for ranking green technologies based on multiple criteria. First, an expert generates a training data set by ranking a subset of the alternative technologies using his/her tacit knowledge and preferences. Then, a machine learning procedure known as logical analysis of data (LAD) is used to detect patterns in these rankings. These patterns are approximations of the mental rules used by the expert to compare and rank the competing alternatives; after validation, they can be used to rank other technologies in the same class as those in the training data. This novel methodology is illustrated here for the case of ranking alternative energy storage technologies for stationary applications. This technique provides a rapid means of eliciting expert knowledge for ranking alternatives based on multiple criteria. © 2021},

abstract={Several attempts are needed to choose the most compatible production system for achieving the desired manufacturing outputs. The significant role of manufacturing strategy deployment is selecting the production system best suited for a manufacturing firm. The appropriately chosen production system (strategic process choice) facilitates a firm to produce “order winning” outputs and provides a production competence to achieve business success. This research presents a novel framework to determine the compatible production system for a manufacturing firm. An integrated three-stage Delphi-MCDM-Bayesian Network (BN) framework has been proposed. The process choice criteria (PCC) considered for deciding production systems are identified through an in-depth literature review and then validated by experts through a Delphi method in the first stage. It resulted in the determination of twenty-six PCC. In the second stage, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) based voting analytical hierarchy process (VAHP) method is adopted to determine each criterion's relative importance for a firm. The relative weights obtained are then used as input for the machine learning (ML) technique- Bayesian network (BN) in the third stage. The BN model quantifies the selection probability of production systems. The proposed Delphi-MCDM-BN framework is demonstrated using a real-life case of a “hydraulic and pneumatic valve” manufacturing firm to select a suitable production system. The three-stage framework is a novel contribution to the literature, which can be used by researchers, practitioners, and manufacturing strategists to choose an appropriate production system for any manufacturing firm. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Arising the Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) concept in Europe, the solar district heating systems (SDHS) present a potential solution to meet the buildings sector's European energy performance directive. Nevertheless, current practices face several technological and economical barriers to ensure service quality. In this context, our work presents a sustainability analysis (technical, economic, environmental, and social) for SDHS integration in the residential sector to meet the NZEB and positive energy building goals. This paper proposes an application of a machine learning model incorporating multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision making to facilitate a sustainability index for the decision-making stakeholders and policymakers. The proposed analysis application is illustrated through retrofitted residential communities with building energy rating (D) at different sizes (10, 25, 50, 100, and 500 houses) located in Emmen (Netherlands) and compared to a standard decentralized heat pump. The optimization results show the ability of SDHS to provide a solar fraction up to 95% in the community of 500 houses. Furthermore, achieving a NZEB status is only approved economically from a community size of 100 houses with a life cycle cost of 41 €/m2 and a payback period of 25 years. These results align with a substantial environmental and social improvement of 78.2% and 29.7%, respectively, compared to the decentralized heat pump. Overall, this study provides policy decision making with an evaluation for positive energy communities and suggests the SDHS integration to meet the global sustainability goals. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={The q-rung orthopair sets (q-ROFSs) is an extended version of conventional orthopair fuzzy sets, such as intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs). The most appealing feature of q-ROFSs is that they provide a wider range of reasonable membership grades and offer decision makers (DMs) more leeway in expressing their legitimate perceptions. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs) play a vital role in computational intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and artificial intelligence. We develop numerous generalized aggregation operators (AOs) for information fusion of q-ROFNs to address some drawbacks of existing AOs. For this objective, we enhance the existing AOs by adding pairs of hesitation within the membership functions, and as a result, we introduce new operational rules for q-ROFNs utilizing Einstein norm operations. Based on suggested operational laws, we introduce new AOs namely “q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive weighted geometric operator,” “q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive ordered weighted geometric operator,” “generalized q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive weighted geometric operator,” “generalized q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive ordered weighted geometric operator,” and “generalized q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein interactive hybrid geometric operator.” Then, certain special cases of proposed AOs are explored and their some essential characteristics are described. A new multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is devised with the help of suggested AOs for modeling uncertainties in the real-life problems. Additionally, a practical application of proposed MCDM approach is presented. Moreover, the comparison analysis, sensitivity analysis and authenticity analysis of proposed MCDM approach with existing approaches is also presented to discuss the feasibility, authenticity, and superiority of the proposed method. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={This study presents the implementation of a non-parametric multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) model, the Multi-group Hierarchy Discrimination (M.H.DIS) model, through the application of an outranking MCDA approach, namely the PROMETHEE II, on a dataset of 114 European unlisted companies operating in the energy sector. Firstly, the M.H.DIS model has been developed following a five-fold cross validation procedure to analyze whether the model explains and replicates a two-group pre-defined classification of companies in the considered sample, provided by Bureau van Dijk's Amadeus database. Since the M.H.DIS method achieves a quite limited satisfactory accuracy in predicting the Amadeus classification in the holdout sample, the PROMETHEE II method has been performed then to provide a benchmark sorting procedure useful for comparison purposes. The analysis indicates that in terms of average accuracy, M.H.DIS model development with the PROMETHEE based classification provides consistently better results than the ones obtained with the Amadeus classification in most of combinations, which have been built with the financial variables covering the main firm's dimensions such as profitability, financial structure, liquidity and turnover. The better results of the proposed model in terms of accuracy rate are also confirmed by the comparison to the most three applied machine-learning methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Predictive models based on the Choquet integral have been applied successfully in machine learning and multi criteria decision making context. The ability of the Choquet integral to recognize and capture non-linear dependencies and its comprehensibility make it a very appealing tool. Yet, its complexity is often an obstacle to estimate model parameters in the presence of a large number of attributes. The other concern is the so-called numerical instability, that is, learning the Choquet integral for a high degree of complexity exhibits a numerical instability. This study addresses complexity reduction and presents a novel algorithm in order to enhance the quality of optimization results and computational efficiency of learning predictive models underlying the Choquet integral. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which caused an outbreak of pneumonia in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly throughout the world. This ongoing pandemic has resulted over 55.6 million cases of COVID-19 leading to 1.34 million deaths in more than 188 countries. However, it has been observed that the death rate is significantly in the lower side for the SAARC countries compared to the First World Nations. In this paper, the possible factors have been represented that determine this uneven distribution of COVID-19 deaths. The significance of the factors has been presented in this paper after the data analysis of the factors from 165 different countries. Based on the correlation of the factors and their critical impact towards the concerned countries death toll, the risk index of each factor has been labeled using analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based MCDM, i.e., multiple criteria decision-making technique. The risk index of all the factors has been used to generate the susceptibility of COVID-19 for each of the countries in study, specifically the SAARC Nations. Finally, the hierarchical clustering was applied to visualize the death toll of the countries corresponding to their susceptibility index. © 2021, The Institution of Engineers (India).},

abstract={Zero-carbon is the current buzzword triggering the minds of every people in the world. The current pandemic situation has given the world an alarm to act towards the reduction/eradication of carbon footprint. Developing countries like India are striving hard to strike a balance between sustainability and global growth. To support the nation, certain measures and their prioritization would be helpful. Motivated by this notion, in this study, a new framework is proposed with double hierarchy fuzzy information, which not only gives experts a better style to articulate preferences linguistically but also makes a rational decision with methodical support. Mayor's transport strategy, 2018 is a popular document that provides valuable information towards sustainable transport practices, and the measures considered in this study are adapted from the same. In this framework, (i) a novel attitudinal evidence-based Bayesian approach is proposed for criteria weight estimation; (ii) experts’ weights are determined by using variance approach, and (iii) Evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) approach is extended for prioritizing zero-carbon measures. These approaches are integrated into a framework and its practicality is exemplified by considering a case example of prioritizing measures for a smart city in India. Finally, comparison with extant methods reveals the merits and shortcomings of the proposal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

In this research activity we discuss the performance of a multicriteria recommender system using different kinds of machine learning and deep learning approaches. We explain in depth about the need for a recommender system, and then discuss the history of recommender systems. We also discuss the different types of filtering techniques and phases of a multicriteria recommender system, and discuss many research activities conducted by researchers around the globe. Then, we describe in depth two machine learning classification approaches and a deep learning approach, which we have implemented in a recommender system. We also show how we have obtained our data set. A comparison table which contains the accuracy and other scores of three different approaches is illustrated, from this table we can easily determine which approach works better in the terms of accuracy, giving the correct recommendations.

abstract={Machine learning (ML) is one of the dominating technologies practiced in both the in-dustrial and academic domains throughout the world. ML algorithms can examine the threats and respond to intrusions and security incidents swiftly in an instinctive way. It plays a critical function in providing a proactive security mechanism in the cybersecurity domain. Cybersecurity ensures the real time protection of information, information systems, and networks from intruders. Several security and privacy reports have cited that there has been a rapid increase in both the frequency and the number of cybersecurity breaches in the last decade. Information security has been compromised by intruders at an alarming rate. Anomaly detection, phishing page identification, software vulnerability diagnosis, malware identification, and denial of services attacks are the main cyber-security issues that demand effective solutions. Researchers and experts have been practicing different approaches to address the current cybersecurity issues and challenges. However, in this research endeavor, our objective is to make an idealness assessment of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) under the hesitant fuzzy (HF) conditions, using a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)-based analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal-solutions (TOPSIS). Hesitant fuzzy sets are useful for addressing decision-making situations in which experts must overcome the reluctance to make a conclusion. The proposed research project would assist the machine learning practitioners and cybersecurity specialists in identifying, selecting, and prioritizing cybersecurity-related attributes for intrusion detection systems, and build more ideal and effective intrusion detection systems. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Hybrid models to detect dementia based on Machine Learning can provide accurate diagnoses in individuals with neurological disorders and cognitive complications caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. This study proposes a hybrid approach, using Machine Learning algorithms associated with the multicriteria method of Verbal Decision Analysis (VDA). Dementia, which affects many HIV-infected individuals, refers to neurodevelopmental and mental disorders. Some manuals standardize the information used in the correct detection of neurological disorders with cognitive complications. Among the most common manuals used are the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10)—both published by World Health Organization (WHO). The model is designed to explore the predictive of specific data. Furthermore, a well-defined database data set improves and optimizes the diagnostic models sought in the research. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Land evaluation is imperative for its efficient use in agriculture. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the suitability of a region in West El-Minia for cultivating some of the major crops using the geographical information system (GIS). The results focus on allocating space for cultivating sugar beet and utilizing the free period of sugar beet in other crops. This exploitation helps to maintain the quality of the land and increase its fertility by using crop rotation with integrated agricultural management. A machine learning technique was implemented using the random forest algorithm (RF) to predict soil suitability classes for sugar beet using geomorphology, terrain attribute and remote sensing data. Fifteen major crops were evaluated using a suitability multicriteria approach in GIS environment for crop rotation decisions. Soil parameters were determined (soil depth, pH, texture, CaCO3, drainage, ECe, and slope) to characterize the land units for soil suitability. Soils of the area were found to be Entisols; Typic Torrifluvents, Typic Torripsamments and Typic Torriorthents and Aridsols; Typic Haplocacids, Calcic Haplosalids and Sodic Haplocalcids. Overall, the studied area was classified into four suitability classes: high “S1”, moderate “S2”, marginal “S3”, and not suitable “N”. The area of each suitability class changed depending on the crop tested. The highest two crops that occupied S1 class were barley with 471.5 ha (representing 6.8% of the total study area) and alfalfa with 157.4 ha (2.3%). In addition, barley, sugar beet, and sorghum occupied the highest areas in S2 class with 6415.3 ha (92.5%), 6111.3 ha (88.11%) and 6111.3 ha (88.1%), respectively. Regarding the S3 class, three different crops (sesame, green pepper, and maize) were the most highly represented by 6151.8 ha (88.7%), 6126.3 ha (88.3%), and 6116.7 ha (88.2%), respectively. In the end, potato and beans occupied the highest areas in N class with 6916.9 ha (99.7%) and 6853.5 ha (98.8%), respectively. The results revealed that the integration of GIS and soil suitability system consists of an appropriate approach for the evaluation of suitable crop rotations for optimized land use planning and to prevent soil degradation. The study recommends using crop rotation, as it contributes to soil sustainability and the control of plant pests and diseases, where the succession of agricultural crops on a scientific basis aims at maintaining the balance of nutrients and fertilizers in the soil. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={An ultimate goal of placing fire detection systems in buildings and structures is to allow for the rapid detection of fire and accurate faster than real time prediction of ensuing fire behavior so that relevant information can be delivered to the appropriate stakeholders. In the near-term, development of detection systems with decreased detection time, better discrimination against nuisance and false alarms, and real-time monitoring of the fire state is a critical interim step. Building comfort and efficiency systems are increasingly incorporating a greater quantity of sensors and these sensors are installed at a greater density than any fire sensor with the exception of the sprinkler. While currently used primarily for building management purposes, the application of these, or similar types of building sensors, for rapid fire detection, fire state determination, and fire forecasting offers great potential.

abstract={Diabetic Retinopathy(DR) is a consequence of Diabetes Mellitus that manifests itself in the alteration of vascular tissue. When an alteration in the correct blood supply occurs, lesions such as micro-aneurysms, haemorrhages and exudates appear. A certain number of Machine Learning(ML) models are available to detect DR. Hence, a benchmarking method of these DR detection ML models can help to choose the best model based on some selected criteria. In this study, after pre-processing DR dataset, inception-v3 is used to extract the features from the images. Based on that, eight models are trained for detecting DR which are evaluated using ten metrics. Using those metrics as criteria, a decision matrix(DM) is formulated. Consequently, with respect to the weighted evaluation matrix, a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making(MCDM) method called Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is assigned to benchmark the DR detection models where Entropy is used to calculate the individual weight of these criteria. The result shows that with the integration of Entropy and TOPSIS, the evaluation and determining problems associated with DR detection methods can be resolved. The AdaBoost classifier is selected as the best detecting model for DR detection which satisfies all the criteria in the best possible way for the data studied. As demonstrated here, the weights are generated by Entropy method which can be replaced by customized weights as needed. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Drowsiness is a risk to human lives in many occupations and activities where full awareness is essential for the safe operation of systems and vehicles, such as driving a car or flying an airplane. Although it is one of the main causes of many road accidents, there is still no reliable definition of drowsiness or a system to reliably detect it. Many researchers have observed correlations between frequency-domain features of the EEG signal and drowsiness, such as an increase in the spectral power of the theta band or a decrease in the spectral power of the beta band. In addition, features calculated as ratio indices between these frequency-domain features show further improvements in detecting drowsiness compared to frequency-domain features alone. This work aims to develop novel multichannel ratio indices that take advantage of the diversity of frequency-domain features from different brain regions. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we use an evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm to find the nearly optimal set of features and channels from which the indices are calculated. Our results show that drowsiness is best described by the powers in delta and alpha bands. Compared to seven existing single-channel ratio indices, our two novel six-channel indices show improvements in (1) statistically significant differences observed between wakefulness and drowsiness segments, (2) precision of drowsiness detection and classification accuracy of the XGBoost algorithm and (3) model performance by saving time and memory during classification. Our work suggests that a more precise definition of drowsiness is needed, and that accurate early detection of drowsiness should be based on multichannel frequency-domain features. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The paper develops a goal programming-based multi-criteria methodology, for assessing different machine learning (ML) regression models under accuracy and time efficiency criteria. The developed methodology provides users with high flexibility in assessing the models as it allows for a fast and computationally efficient sensitivity analysis of accuracy and time significance weights as well as accuracy and time significance threshold values. Four regression models were assessed, namely the decision tree, random forest, support vector and the neural network. The developed methodology was employed to forecast the time to failures of NASA Turbofans. The results reveal that decision tree regression (DTR) seems to be preferred for low values of accuracy weights (up to 30%) and low accuracy and time efficiency threshold values. As the accuracy weights tend to increase and for higher accuracy and time efficiency threshold values, random forest regression (RFR) seems to be the best choice. The preference for the RFR model however, seems to change towards the adoption of the neural network for accuracy weights equal to and higher than 90%. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Evaluation of forest sites capability (EFSC) is important for the restoration of degraded areas. The current costly EFSC approaches developed based on forest stand structure criteria is too costly for less developed countries (LDC) and not suitable for severely degraded lands. This paper describes an inexpensive Landscape-fuzzy approach for forest capability evaluation (LFAFCE) that can be used to restore degraded forest areas especially in LDC. Five physical criteria of slope, hillshade, altitude, precipitation, and geo formation were evaluated in the Zagros region of western Iran using the fuzzy membership functions, prioritized by analytic network process (ANP), and combined with GIS-based weighted linear combination. We then performed multi-criteria evaluation integrated by GIS. Given the positive correlation between the independent variable of EFSC and the dependent variable of the dominant tree height, the model results were validated based on the linear regression of the relationship between the two variables. The results of the validation showed that the linear regression model with appropriate coefficient of determination was significant. The results of EFSC by LFAFCE showed that most of the forest area was allocated to two classes: well (75%) and moderate (21.8%). In total, only 3.2% of the area belonged to the marginal (0.4%), high (0.1%), and unsuitable regions (2.7%) classes. Our results demonstrate that LFAFCE is valid for low-cost evaluation of degraded area in Zagros and for other similar areas, if calibrated, where normal forest mass parameters are not available. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Missing data is a common problem in real-world data sets and it is amongst the most complex topics in computer science and many other research domains. The common ways to cope with missing values are either by elimination or imputation depending of the volume of the missing data and its distribution nature. It becomes imperative to come up with new imputation approaches along with efficient algorithms. Though most existing imputation methods focus on a moderate amount of missing data, imputation for high missing rates over 80% is still important but challenging. Even with the existence of some works in addressing high missing volume issue, they mostly rely on imputing reference dataset (Complete Datasets for evaluation) after they create artificial missing values and impute it to measure the accuracy of their proposed techniques. So far, the option of imputing high proportions of missing values with no reference comparison dataset (Original Dataset with highly missing values) have been often ignored or overlooked. Therefore, we propose a missing data imputation approach for high volumes of missing values with no reference comparison dataset. The approach makes use of pre-processing measures and breaking the dataset into small continuous non-missing portions then using Multi Criteria Decision-making analysis to select a portion of data which is representative of the entire broken datasets. This portion helps to create reference comparisons and expands the missing dataset through artificial missing-making procedures with different percentages and imputation using different machine learning techniques. This study conducted two experiments using BMI datasets with more than 80% of missing values, derived from the National Child Development Centre (NCDRC) at Sultan Idris Education University (UPSI), Malaysia. The results show that our approach capability in reconstructing datasets with huge missing values. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Large volumes of data have been accumulated in identical or very similar contexts of decision making. To generate accurate and explanatory decision recommendations by using these data, this paper proposes a data-driven multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and the evidential reasoning (ER) approach. In the method, based on the assessments of all historical alternatives, a comparison framework is designed to determine the most appropriate ML algorithm with the highest predictive accuracy. An optimization model is then constructed to connect the appropriate ML algorithm with the ER approach. Through the optimization model, the difference between overall assessments derived from the ER approach and the predicted results derived from the appropriate ML algorithm is minimized to learn criterion weights. The learned criterion weights are used to generate accurate and explanatory decisions. Such a combination takes advantage of high predictability of ML algorithms and favorable interpretability of the ER approach simultaneously. To demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method, it is used to aid the diagnosis of thyroid nodules for a tertiary hospital located in Hefei, Anhui, China. Its merits are further highlighted by its comparison with two traditional ER approaches and the appropriate ML algorithm. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production system, and the sector accounts for more than half of all fish consumed. Its potential as a sustainable food source has been recognised within the EU Farm to Fork strategy and by the targeting of EU Green Deal research funds. Aquafeed is the primary source of environmental cost in farmed finfish and shrimp life cycle assessments (LCA), and thus, emerging ingredients have a key role to play in increasing its sustainability. This paper proposes that the development and ‘design’ of feed compositions can be disrupted by innovative approaches that simultaneously optimise—via multicriteria analysis—ingredient selection through leveraging economic, nutritional, life cycle cost and environmental datasets. This would be supported by the ongoing collection and curation of these same resources. Further, integration of these disparate resources can enable advanced ingredient traceability. The outcome of such an approach would greatly contribute to increasingly efficient aquafeed production. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={GIS-based mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) is a computer-aided methodology for delineating and better constraining target areas deemed prospective for mineral deposits of a particular type. The underlying algorithms are well-established and well-understood, but on the whole, MPM that is a multi-faceted and multi-criteria approach, is faced with a high degree of uncertainty. We distinguish three principal types of uncertainties: (1) data-related (e.g., the sometimes erroneous, inadequate, incomplete, unevenly distributed or poorly resolved nature of the input data); (2) model-related (e.g., the diversity and inherent natural variability of mineral deposits, our lack of complete knowledge of the targeted mineral deposit type, and our imperfect ability to interpret geoscience datasets); and (3) judgment-related (e.g., the influence of cognitive heuristics and biases). In this contribution, we review and characterize the key uncertainties listed above and provide possible solutions as to how they may be recognized and mitigated in the context of MPM. This review also clearly illustrates the need for future studies designed to carefully monitor each step of the MPM process and aims at reducing uncertainty by, for example, (1) using carefully vetted, high-quality input data, (2) developing targeting models based on the best possible understanding of the underlying mineral deposit models and backed by machine learning-based simulations of likely ore-forming processes, and (3) adopting advanced methods such as deep learning algorithms for effective integrating of predictor maps. © 2021, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

abstract={Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) encompass approximately 16.2% of India's geographical area and characterized as a montane climatic zone. The ambient temperature of this region is extremely low, with a minimum average temperature of 2–18 °C. Major settlements in this region are located at an altitude of more than 1000 m above sea level. Therefore, according to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), India, there is excessive thermal and electrical energy consumption in these regions pertaining to space heating. Moreover, the current energy sources utilized are not clean sources and hence contribute towards CO2 emissions. A building-integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT) system is modelled to provide the necessary thermal energy alongside electricity for space heating intended for the climatic conditions of Srinagar. The study utilized an application-centric approach in modelling and analyzing the BIPVT system and, hence quantifying the annual outputs for Srinagar, India. Furthermore, the developed mathematical model is used for training an artificial neural network to predict the annual thermal and exergy outputs of the system based on six different model parameters. Three designs, one operational and two application-based parameters are considered as inputs to the network. Moreover, a multi-criteria decision-making method is employed to determine the best set of BIPVT parameters giving optimum annual thermal and exergy outputs along with electrical, thermal and exergy efficiencies of the modelled system. The modelled neural network performed reasonably well against the unseen test dataset in predicting the BIPVT yield with an R2 value &gt;0.97. An optimum annual thermal and exergy gains of 2,25,459 kWh and 67,132.38 kWh, respectively, are quantified for the best set of BIPVT parameters. The system's optimum average electrical (power conversion), thermal and exergy efficiencies are observed to be 14.87, 56.28, and 17.59%, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The availability of multiple data sources, such as passenger load in trains or ticketing logs, provides an interesting opportunity to develop decision support tools to help passengers better plan their trips around the city and to enhance their travel experience. We present, in this paper, a multi-criteria journey planner that incorporates train load predictions as criteria. To this end, on the one hand, we enrich the proposed routes with predictive indicators of passenger flow such as the load on board the trains. These indicators are computed for each section of the itinerary using machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, we design a journey planner that incorporates the predicted load in its search criteria. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={With increasing digitization, new opportunities emerge concerning the availability and use of data in the energy sector. A comprehensive literature review shows an abundance in available unsupervised clustering algorithms as well as internal, relative and external cluster validation indices (cvi) to evaluate the results. Yet, the comparison of different clustering results on the same dataset, executed with different algorithms and a specific practical goal in mind still proves scientifically challenging. A large variety of cvi are described and consolidated in commonly used composite indices (e.g. Davies-Bouldin-Index, silhouette-Index, Dunn-Index). Previous works show the challenges surrounding these composite indices since they serve a generalized cluster quality evaluation. However, this does not suit individual clustering goals in many cases. The presented paper introduces the current state of science, existing cluster validation indices and proposes a practical method to combine them to an individual composite index, using Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (mcda). The methodology is applied on two energy economic use cases for clustering load profiles of bidirectional electric vehicles and municipalities. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={A sentiment analysis of Arabic texts is an important task in many commercial applications such as Twitter. This study introduces a multi-criteria method to empirically assess and rank classifiers for Arabic sentiment analysis. Prominent machine learning algorithms were deployed to build classification models for Arabic sentiment analysis classifiers. Moreover, an assessment of the top five machine learning classifiers’ performances measures was discussed to rank the performance of the classifier. We integrated the top five ranking methods with evaluation metrics of machine learning classifiers such as accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure, CPU Time, classification error, and area under the curve (AUC). The method was tested using Saudi Arabic product reviews to compare five popular classifiers. Our results suggest that deep learning and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers perform best with accuracy 85.25%, 82.30%; precision 85.30, 83.87%; recall 88.41%, 83.89; F-measure 86.81, 83.87%; classification error 14.75, 17.70; and AUC 0.93, 0.90, respectively. They outperform decision trees, K-nearest neighbours (K-NN), and Naïve Bayes classifiers. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Ground Penetrating Radar Survey has been conducted on all the slopes in the ‘Very High to Severe’ landslide susceptible zones wherein near-surface lithologic setting, presence of paleo-slopes and microstructural features like fractures/faults and poorly stratified debris flow have been imaged that provided favorable subsurface conditions for slope failure. Finite element method-based slope failure analysis for Newmark displacement estimates factor of safety (FoS) value that acts as the proxy in defining the degree of slope instability is seen to vary between 1.905 and 2.357 in the ‘Low to Moderate’ landslide susceptible zone while it ranges between 1.051 and 1.652 in the ‘High’ landslide susceptible zone and between 0.649 and 1.349 in the ‘Very High to Severe’ landslide inventory subset along the slopes under both gravity loading and seismic shaking in the terrain. The slope stability analysis puts the yield acceleration between 0.0012 and 0.11984 m/s2 and the total deformation between 0.0027 and 1.4484 m. All these parameters in the classified landslide susceptible zones in unison demonstrate how unstable are the terrain slopes in the ‘High to Severe’ landslide susceptible zones. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={This study determines the potential barriers to achieving circularity in dairy supply chains; it proposes a framework which covers big data driven solutions to deal with the suggested barriers. The main contribution of the study is to propose a framework by making ideal matching and ranking of big data solutions to barriers to circularity in dairy supply chains. This framework further offers a specific roadmap as a practical contribution while investigating companies with restricted resources. In this study the main barriers are classified as ‘economic’, ‘environmental’, ‘social and legal’, ‘technological’, ‘supply chain management’ and ‘strategic’ with twenty-seven sub-barriers. Various big data solutions such as machine learning, optimization, data mining, cloud computing, artificial neural network, statistical techniques and social network analysis have been suggested. Big data solutions are matched with circularity focused barriers to show which solutions succeed in overcoming barriers. A hybrid decision framework based on the fuzzy ANP and the fuzzy VIKOR is developed to find the weights of the barriers and to rank the big data driven solutions. The results indicate that among the main barriers, ‘economic’ was of the highest importance, followed by ‘technological’, ‘environmental’, ‘strategic’, ‘supply chain management’ then ‘social and legal barrier’ in dairy supply chains. In order to overcome circularity focused barriers, ‘optimization’ is determined to be the most important big data solution. The other solutions to overcoming proposed challenges are ‘data mining’, ‘machine learning’, ‘statistical techniques’ and ‘artificial neural network’ respectively. The suggested big data solutions will be useful for policy makers and managers to deal with potential barriers in implementing circularity in the context of dairy supply chains. © 2021},

abstract={The development of sustainable energy systems is very important to addressing the economic, environmental, and social pressures of the energy sector. Globally, buildings consume up to 40% of the world’s total energy. By 2030, it is expected to increase to 50%. Therefore, the world is facing a great challenge to overcome these problems related to global energy production. Malaysia is one of the top consumers of primary energy in Asia. In 2018, primary energy consumption for Malaysia was 3.79 quadrillion btu at an average annual rate of 4.58%. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review on several previous studies of energy consumption in the world, especially in Malaysia, and how geographical information system (GIS) methods have been used for the spatial assessment of energy efficiency. Indeed, strategies of energy efficiency are essential in energy policy that could be created using various approaches used for energy savings in buildings. The findings of this review reveal that, for estimating energy consumption, exploring renewable energy sources, and investigating solar radiation, several geographic information system techniques such as multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are mainly utilized. The result indicates that the fuzzy DS method can more reliably determine the optimal PV farm locations. The 3D models are also regarded as an effective tool for estimating solar radiation, since this method generates a 3D model exportable to software tools. In addition, GIS and 3D can contribute to several purposes, such as sunlight access to buildings in urban areas, city growth prediction models and analysis of the habitability of public places. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The successful convergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and distributed machine learning have leveraged to realise the concept of Federated Learning (FL) with the collaborative efforts of a large number of low-powered and small-sized edge nodes. In Wireless Networks (WN), an energy-efficient transmission is a fundamental challenge since the energy resource of edge nodes is restricted. In this paper, we propose an Energy-aware Multi-Criteria Federated Learning (EaMC-FL) model for edge computing. The proposed model enables to collaboratively train a shared global model by aggregating locally trained models in selected representative edge nodes (workers). The involved workers are initially partitioned into a number of clusters with respect to the similarity of their local model parameters. At each training round a small set of representative workers is selected on the based of multi-criteria evaluation that scores each node representativeness (importance) by taking into account the trade-off among the node local model performance, consumed energy and battery lifetime. We have demonstrated through experimental results the proposed EaM C-Flmodel is capable of reducing the energy consumed by the edge nodes by lowering the transmitted data. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={With the growing capabilities of autonomous vehicles, there is a higher demand for sophisticated and pragmatic quality assurance approaches for machine learning-enabled systems in the automotive AI context. The use of simulation-based prototyping platforms provides the possibility for early-stage testing, enabling inexpensive testing and the ability to capture critical corner-case test scenarios. Simulation-based testing properly complements conventional on-road testing. However, due to the large space of test input parameters in these systems, the efficient generation of effective test scenarios leading to the unveiling of failures is a challenge. This paper presents a study on testing pedestrian detection and emergency braking system of the Baidu Apollo autonomous driving platform within the SVL simulator. We propose an evolutionary automated test generation technique that generates failure-revealing scenarios for Apollo in the SVL environment. Our approach models the input space using a generic and flexible data structure and benefits a multi-criteria safety-based heuristic for the objective function targeted for optimization. This paper presents the results of our proposed test generation technique in the 2021 IEEE Autonomous Driving AI Test Challenge. In order to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach, we also report the results from a baseline random generation technique. Our evaluation shows that the proposed evolutionary test case generator is more effective at generating failure-revealing test cases and provides higher diversity between the generated failures than the random baseline. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The determination of cropland suitability is a major step for adapting to the increased food demands caused by population growth, climate change and environmental contamination. This study presents a novel cropland suitability assessment approach based on machine learning, which overcomes the limitations of the conventional GIS-based multicriteria analysis by increasing computational efficiency, accuracy and objectivity of the prediction. The suitability assessment method was developed and evaluated for soybean cultivation within two 50 × 50 km subsets located in the continental biogeoregion of Croatia, in the four-year period during 2017–2020. Two biophysical vegetation properties, leaf area index (LAI) and a fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), were utilized to train and test machine learning models. The data derived from a medium-resolution satellite mission PROBA-V were prime indicators of cropland suitability, having a high correlation to crop health, yield and biomass in previous studies. A variety of climate, soil, topography and vegetation covariates were used to establish a relationship with the training samples, with a total of 119 covariates being utilized per yearly suitability assessment. Random forest (RF) produced a superior prediction accuracy compared to support vector machine (SVM), having the mean overall accuracy of 76.6% to 68.1% for Subset A and 80.6% to 79.5% for Subset B. The 6.1% of the highly suitable FAO suitability class for soybean cultivation was determined on the sparsely utilized Subset A, while the intensively cultivated agricultural land produced only 1.5% of the same suitability class in Subset B. The applicability of the proposed method for other crop types adjusted by their respective vegetation periods, as well as the upgrade to high-resolution Sentinel-2 images, will be a subject of future research. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Dams can effectively regulate the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources, where the rationality of dam siting determines whether the role of dams can be effectively performed. This paper reviews the research literature on dam siting in the past 20 years, discusses the methods used for dam siting, focuses on the factors influencing dam siting, and assesses the impact of different dam functions on siting factors. The results show the following: (1) Existing siting methods can be categorized into three types—namely, GIS/RS-based siting, MCDM-and MCDM-GIS-based siting, and machine learning-based siting. GIS/RS emphasizes the ability to capture and analyze data, MCDM has the advantage of weighing the importance of the relationship between multiple factors, and machine learning methods have a strong ability to learn and process complex data. (2) Site selection factors vary greatly, depending on the function of the dam. For dams with irrigation and water supply as the main purpose, the site selection is more focused on the evaluation of water quality. For dams with power generation as the main purpose, the hydrological factors characterizing the power generation potential are the most important. For dams with flood control as the main purpose, the topography and geological conditions are more important. (3) The integration of different siting methods and the siting of new functional dams in the existing research is not sufficient. Future research should focus on the integration of different methods and disciplines, in order to explore the siting of new types of dams. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The accurate modeling of landslide risk is essential pre-requisite for the development of reliable landslide control and mitigation strategies. However, landslide risk depends on the poorly known environmental and socio-economic factors for regional patterns of landslide occurrence probability and vulnerability, which constitute still a matter of research. Here, a hybrid model is described that couples data mining and multi-criteria decision-making methods for hazard and vulnerability mapping and presents its application to landslide risk assessment in Golestan Province, Northeastern Iran. To this end, landslide probability is mapped using three state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms—Maximum Entropy, Support Vector Machine and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production—and combine the results with Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process computations of vulnerability to obtain the landslide risk map. Based on obtained results, a discussion is presented on landslide probability as a function of the main relevant human-environmental conditioning factors in Golestan Province. In particular, from the response curves of the machine learning algorithms, it can be found that the probability p of landslide occurrence decreases nearly exponentially with the distance x to the next road, fault, or river. Specifically, the results indicated that p≈ exp (- λx) where the length scale λ is about 0.0797 km−1 for road, 0.108 km−1 for fault, and 0.734 km−1 0.734 km−1 for river. Furthermore, according to the results, p follows, approximately, a lognormal function of elevation, while the equation p=p0-K(θ-θ0)2 fits well the dependence of landslide modeling on the slope-angle θ, with p0≈0.64,θ0≈25.6∘and|K|≈6.6×10-4. However, the highest predicted landslide risk levels in Golestan Province are located in the south and southwest areas surrounding Gorgan City, owing to the combined effect of dense local human occupation and strongly landslide-prone environmental conditions. Obtained results provide insights for quantitative modeling of landslide risk, as well as for priority planning in landslide risk management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Accurate and stable prediction of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) is vital for managing energy systems, irrigation planning, and also decision making for future investment. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models for prediction GHI generally have high performance, but suffer from instability and uncertainty, especially in different climate areas. Therefore, the aim of this study is to implement an ensemble strategy based on the Integrated Bayesian Multi-model Uncertainty Estimation Framework (IBMUEF) for simultaneous input parameters and model structure uncertainty quantification in AIs. In this study, robust prediction techniques of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms (Multiverse optimization (MVO), Sine-cosine algorithm (SCA), Salp swarm algorithm (SSA)) are hybridized with machine learning models of Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for GHI predictions. The ensemble IBMUEF combines the advantages of developed models to improve the predicting performance. Comparing results of IBMUEF against the developed individual models show the predictive skill and strength of IBMUEF for four meteorological stations in two climate areas (arid and semi-arid) located in Iran. The results of developed individual models showed that all six hybrid models (ANFIS-MVO, ANFIS-SCA, ANFIS-SSA, ELM-MVO, ELM-SCA, ELM-SSA) performed well in four stations. The ranking of models carried out by Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method of Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS). The ANFIS-MVO model with the highest rank was selected as the best model that R2, RMSE, MAE, and NSE values were ranged from 0.9929 to 0.9989, from 16.23 to 54.78 Wh/m2/day, from 4.21 to 10.39 Wh/m2/day, and from 0.993 to 0.999, respectively. The accuracy of ensemble IBMUEF based on the average RMSE was 23.7% and 32.2% better than the ANFIS-MVO model in arid and semi-arid climates, respectively. Evaluation results related to input parameters and model structure uncertainties proved the superiority of ensemble IBMUEF over the individual models, while 95% confidence interval covered almost 96% of observation data. The results highlighted the significance of combining individual models in IBMUEF for more accurate prediction of GHI with a suitable level of uncertainty. In conclusion, simultaneous considering of model input uncertainty and model parameter uncertainty is crucial for obtaining realistic and certain GHI predictions and correct quantification of the uncertainty bounds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Auto-scaling systems can dynamically scale the required resources for cloud-based services at runtime. This is an effective mechanism, enabling services to adapt to environmental changes. These systems establish the foundation for achieving elasticity in the modern cloud computing paradigm. Given the dynamic and uncertain nature of the shared cloud infrastructure, cloud auto-scaling systems are one of the most complex and sophisticated created artifacts, aiming to achieve self-aware, self-adaptive, and dependable runtime scaling. To find an effective solution to this problem, an accurate prediction of the required amount of workload as well as the system metrics for future time periods are needed. Various solutions have already been proposed to tackle this problem. Many solutions make use of machine learning, statistical, and ensemble methods. In this paper, we view the auto-scaling problem as a sequence model and apply the convolutional neural networks to predict the future workload of cloud services. Also, by using neural networks, we obtain a mapping between the predicted workload as well as the real-time and future amounts of the required resources. We have also proposed a decision-making mechanism that takes into account different and sometimes conflicting user criteria resulting in the best-compromised decision. To this aim, we have used TOPSIS as a multi-criteria decision-making method for the decision-making component. In the evaluation section, we have examined the amount of prediction error, the amount of service level agreement violations, as well as the amount of resources' under-utilization. Evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach for predicting the workload shows a 4 percent improvement over the existing approaches. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The practice of developing product or system safety standards is currently conducted with high level of subjectivity, which affects the reliability of development outcomes. The decision to adopt specific safety requirements into the standard is usually based on the knowledge, intuition and experience of the technical expert involved in developing the body of the safety standard made up of those requirements or specifications. This is usually carried out without analyzing risk attributes or factors addressed by each safety requirement constituting a safety standard. This can lead to inaccuracy and lack of reliability due to either under-estimation or over-estimation of risks involved. This research presents unprecedented, novel, structured and objective methodology, that aims to improve the practice of developing safety standards. In order to accomplish the above end, the proposed methodology acts to prioritize the system’ safety requirements of each system's design elements based on a set of commonly identified risk factors they address. We have investigated the currently existing risk prioritization and multi-criterion decision making techniques, and found that machine learning data clustering approaches can be adequate especially in case of relatively large number of assessed decision alternatives (i.e., the assessed safety requirements). We have elaborated the merits of the proposed clustering-based methodology over existing prominent ones. The proposed methodology starts with analyzing product or system safety to identify common risk factors. A numerical scale is used to enable objective quantification of risk factors’ values for each safety requirement by multiple experts. The obtained experts’ numerical assessments of each safety requirement are then averaged to represent the raw data set containing risk profiles of each safety requirement assessed. This risk factors data set is then used by fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, to organize them into groups of different level of priorities, so as to prioritize their corresponding safety requirements. We have applied the proposed methodology on a real case study of developing school bus safety standard. The main benefit of the proposed methodology includes its capability to support the safety standards development practitioners and policy makers, as well as technical experts in objectively and systematically carry out the critical decision of adoption, exclusion and update of the safety requirements into the developed safety standard. Additionally, it can efficiently guide safety engineers and inspectors to undertake more reliable and structured risk assessment process. Over and above, the implementation of the proposed methodology is guaranteed to result in more reliable, accurate and risk-informed safety standard. © 2021},

abstract={Time series prediction (TSP) is a process of using data collected at different times in the past for statistical analysis, so as to speculate on the trend of things, where the non-stationary and non-linear characteristics of data portray a hard setting for predictive tasks. Obviously, there will be no single model that could perform the best for all TSP issues. Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) technique achieves more accurate and robust performance than a single model, due to that it aims to select an ensemble of the most competent models in a dynamic fashion according to each test sample. A variety of DES approaches have been proposed to address pattern classification problems, but little work has been conducted on the research of TSP adopting the DES paradigm. Commonly, the DES approaches work by the definition of a single criterion to evaluate the capability of base classifiers. However, only one criterion is often inadequate for the comprehensive evaluation of classifier power. Thus, in this paper, a multiple criteria Dynamic Ensemble Pruning (DEP) technique exploiting meta-learning ad-hoc for TSP, termed DEP-TSPmeta, based on the inspiration from a state-of-the-art META-DES framework specifically presented for classification tasks, is developed. Within DEP-TSPmeta, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machines (H-ELMs) are integrated as the base models, and four distinct meta-attributes collections, i.e., hard prediction, local accuracy, global accuracy, and prediction confidence, are presented. Each set of meta-attributes corresponds to a specific assessment criterion, i.e., the prediction accuracy in local area of the eigenspace, the overall local accuracy, the prediction accuracy in global area of the decision space, and the confidence level of predictor. A desirable meta-predictor, obtained by training on the strength of these meta-attributes, is the key to deciding whether a base predictor is capable of predicting the unseen instance well or not. Those incapable base predictors determined by the meta-predictor will be pruned and the capable predictors will be expanded into the final dynamic ensemble system. The size of the sets of meta-attributes is specified dynamically by genetic algorithm for different time series benchmark datasets. Empirical results on eight benchmark datasets with different time granularities have verified that, the proposed DEP-TSPmeta algorithm possesses dramatically improved prediction performance at different granularities, when compared against three other DES approaches and four static selective ensemble learning methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In a computational medical model, diagnosis is the classification of disease status in the terms of abnormal or positive, normal or negative or intermediate stages. Different Machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are extensively and successfully used in disease diagnosis. However, there is no single classifier that can solve all classification problems. Selecting an optimal classifier for a problem is difficult, and it has become a relevant subject in the area. This paper focuses on grammar-based automatic programming (GAP) to build optimized discriminant functions for medical data classification in any arbitrary language. These techniques have an implicit power of automatic feature selection and feature extraction. This work carries out an in-depth investigation of the use of different GAP algorithms in the medical data classification problem. The objective is to identify the benefits and limitations of algorithms of this nature in the current problem. Classical classifiers were also considered for comparison purposes. Fourteen medical data sets were used in the experiments, and seven performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, geometric-mean, F-measure, and false-positive rate are used to evaluate the performance of the produced classifier. The multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) demonstrates that GAP approaches are able to produce suitable classifiers for a given problem, and the GS performs better than other classical classifiers in medical data classification. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Autonomous Driving (AD) systems are heavily reliant on supervised models. In these approaches, a model is trained to detect only a predefined number of obstacles. However, for applications like railway obstacle detection, the training dataset is limited and not all possible obstacle classes are known beforehand. For such safety-critical applications, this situation is problematic and could limit the performance of obstacle detection in autonomous trains. In this paper, we propose an exploratory study using unsupervised models based on a large set of generated convolutional autoencoder models to detect obstacles on railway's track level. The study was conducted based on three components: loss functions, activations and optimizers. Existing works rely on fixing thresholds to judge the performance of the model. We propose instead a methodology based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate the performance of all models. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of gap-score to evaluate each model by calculating the average difference between the reconstruction score on images with and without obstacles. The aim is to find models maximizing the average of gap-scores and rank them according to their performances. Experimental results show that the evaluated models can provide up to 68 % average gap-score. © 2021 IEEE.},

This paper has two main objectives. The first is to predict the rates of financial catastrophe and determine the importance of the chosen variables for predicting the rates of catastrophe for high, medium and low income levels in the different Spanish regions. To this end, a comparison will be made between two machine learning algorithms, one based on elastic-net regressions to estimate generalised linear models; and another based on random forest algorithms, which makes it possible to capture the possible non-linearities and interactions that may occur in the data. The results show that the random forest is more appropriate. Based on these results, the second objective is to establish a ranking of the different regions by income level for the different categories of financial catastrophic expenditure rates, using a discrete multi-criteria decision model (PROMETHEE method). © 2021 Ascociacion Internacional de Economia Aplicada.

abstract={Generally, decision making in urban planning has progressively become difficult due to the uncertain, convoluted, and multi-criteria nature of urban issues. Even though there has been a growing interest to this domain, traditional decision support systems are no longer able to effectively support the decision process. This paper aims to elaborate an intelligent decision support system (IDSS) that provides relevant assistance to urban planners in urban projects. This research addresses the use of new techniques that contribute to intelligent decision making: machine learning classifiers, naïve Bayes classifier, and agglomerative clustering. Finally, a prototype is being developed to concretize the proposition. © 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={This chapter addresses vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), one of the most well-known combinatorial optimization problems with many real-world applications in the transportation sector. This chapter proposes a three-stage approach for VRPTW and presents an application of this approach to a real-life problem. The stages of the approach include clustering of customers, determining feasible routes and their criteria values for each cluster, and selecting the best routes for each cluster based on multi-criteria decision analysis. In the first stage of the proposed approach, a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering-based assignment algorithm is used. The second stage includes predicting travel times between nodes based on GPS data with support vector regression (SVR) and applying the proposed feasible route determination and criteria value calculation algorithm using these predictions and other inputs. In the last stage, routes are selected with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for each cluster. © 2021, IGI Global.},

abstract={Dealing with uncertainty and imprecision is important in many application areas of artificial intelligence such as expert systems, fuzzy control, robotics, computer based systems, machine learning or data recovery. Bousi~Prolog is a Prolog that enables working with both fuzzy linguistic and linguistic tools to direct Prolog systems used in logical programming to compute with paradigm phrases that can be of great help to linguistic resources. In the study, an example of route prioritization is applied to show that Bousi~Prolog can be used in multi-criteria decision making models. Route prioritization is a complex problem where multiple criteria are reviewed simultaneously and depending on the criteria determined, it is necessary to make the most appropriate choice under the desired conditions with expert opinions. However, how the results change according to the changing opinions of the decision makers and the ranking results that appear in different decisions should be observed while weighting and selecting. For this purpose, a flexible, deductive sample database that stores route information has been prepared. With the fuzzy decisions of the three decision makers, the route weights are calculated with the help of Bousi~Prolog, and the changes in the route order are shown. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Many complex problems require a multi-criteria decision, such as the COVID-19 pandemic that affected nearly all activities in the world. In this regard, this study aims to develop a multi-criteria decision support system considering the sustainability, feasibility, and success rate of possible approaches. Therefore, two models have been developed: Geo-AHP (applying geo-based data) and BN-Geo-AHP using probabilistic techniques (Bayesian network). The ranking method of Geo-APH is generalized, and the equations are provided in a way that adding new elements and variables would be possible by experts. Then, to improve the ranking, the application of the probabilistic technique of a Bayesian network and the role of machine learning for database and weight of each parameter are explained, and the model of BN-Geo-APH has been developed. In the next step, to show the application of the developed Geo-AHP and BN-Geo-AHP models, we selected the new pandemic of COVID-19 that affected nearly all activities, and we used both models for analysis. For this purpose, we first analyzed the available data about COVID-19 and previous studies about similar virus infections, and then we ranked the main approaches and alternatives in confronting the pandemic of COVID-19. The analysis of approaches with the selected alternatives shows the first ranked approach is massive vaccination and the second ranked is massive swabs or other tests. The third is the use of medical masks and gloves, and the last ranked is the lockdown, mostly due to its major negative impact on the economy and individuals. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The global pandemic of COVID-19 poses a huge threat to the health and lives of people all over the world, and brings unprecedented pressure to the medical system. We need to establish a practical method to improve the efficiency of treatment and optimize the allocation of medical resources. Due to the influx of a large number of patients into the hospital and the running of medical resources, blood routine test became the only possible check while COVID-19 patients first go to a fever clinic in a community hospital. This study aims to establish an efficient method to identify key indicators from initial blood routine test results for COVID-19 severity prediction. We determined that age is a key indicator for severity predicting of COVID-19, with an accuracy of 0.77 and an AUC of 0.92. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction, we proposed a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) algorithm, which combines the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, to further select effective indicators from patients’ initial blood test results. The MCDM algorithm selected 3 dominant feature subsets: {Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT} with a selection rate of 44%, {Age, NEUT, LYMC} with a selection rate of 38%, and {Age, WBC, LYMC} with a selection rate of 9%. Using these feature subsets, the optimized prediction model could achieve an accuracy of 0.82 and an AUC of 0.93. These results indicated that Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT were the key factors for COVID-19 severity prediction. Using age and the indicators selected by the MCDM algorithm from initial blood routine test results can effectively predict the severity of COVID-19. Our research could not only help medical workers identify patients with severe COVID-19 at an early stage, but also help doctors understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 through key indicators. © 2021 Luo et al.

abstract={Energy demand and generation are common variables that need to be forecast in recent years, due to the necessity for energy self-consumption via storage and Demand Side Management. This work studies multi-step time series forecasting models for energy with confidence intervals for each time point, accompanied by a demand optimization algorithm, for energy management in partly or completely isolated islands. Particularly, the forecasting is performed via numerous traditional and contemporary machine learning regression models, which receive as input past energy data and weather forecasts. During pre-processing, the historical data are grouped into sets of months and days of week based on clustering models, and a separate regression model is automatically selected for each of them, as well as for each forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the multi-criteria optimization algorithm is implemented for demand scheduling with load shifting, assuming that, at each time point, demand is within its confidence interval resulting from the forecasting algorithm. Both clustering and multiple model training proved to be beneficial to forecasting compared to traditional training. The Normalized Root Mean Square Error of the forecasting models ranged approximately from 0.17 to 0.71, depending on the forecasting difficulty. It also appeared that the optimization algorithm can simultaneously increase renewable penetration and achieve load peak shaving, while also saving consumption cost in one of the tested islands. The global improvement estimation of the optimization algorithm ranged approximately from 5% to 38%, depending on the flexibility of the demand patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Flood mitigation and risk management is a very challenging task that requires accurate identification of flood hazard/susceptible regions for adequate planning and management. Accurate determination of locations that are prone to flood hazards needs the application and adaptation of techniques that will provide flood hazard/susceptibility maps with minimal uncertainty. Previous literature reviews on flood hazard analysis have focused on the flood hazard mapping methods such as hydrodynamic, conceptual, and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). Thus, this current study thoroughly reviews studies that applied MCDM, statistical, and machine learning (ML) methods in the identification of flood hazard/susceptible regions. The paper presents information about these methods, their integration in flood studies, strengths, limitations, uncertainty, and recent developments. Conclusively, the paper provided observations and recommendations to enhance the existing information for relevant knowledge in future studies.

abstract={Mapping mineral prospectivity (MPM) is mostly beset with prediction uncertainties, which are generally categorized into (a) stochastic and (b) systemic types. The stochastic type is usually linked to the low quality as well as insufficiency/inefficiency of data used. In contrast, inaccurate selection of exploration criteria, exaggerated and arbitrary weighting of spatial evidence layers resulting from subjective judgment of analyst and applying an integration methodology, which is not able to consider the complexities of geological processes, are main sources of systemic type. This paper aims for reducing the second type of MPM uncertainty in delineating favorable exploration targets for Cu-Au mineralization in the Moalleman District, NE Iran. Thus, several efficient evidence layers were translated from geospatial criteria (e.g., geochemical, geological, structural and hydrothermal alterations) and were considered for integration purpose in the study area. Then, an improved data-driven simple additive weight (data-driven SAW) procedure was introduced for generating prospectivity model. In this procedure, prediction-area plots and frequency ratio method were applied for assigning objective weights to efficient evidence layers and their corresponding classes, respectively. Furthermore, a supervised algorithm for machine learning classification namely support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function kernel was executed for comparison purposes. The results indicated that the two prospectivity models are succeeded in delineating favorable targets of mineralization; however, the SVM model is more reliable than data-driven SAW in predicting high-potential areas of mineralization. © 2021, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

abstract={Multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) is a family of analytic approaches to depicting the rationale of human decisions. To better interpret the contributions of individual attributes to the decision maker, the conventional MCDA approaches assume that the attributes are monotonic and preference independence. However, the capacity in describing the decision maker's preferences is sacrificed as a result of model simplification. To meet the decision maker's demand for more accurate and interpretable decision models, we propose a novel hybrid method, namely Neural Network-based Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (NN-MCDA), which combines MCDA model and machine learning to achieve better prediction performance while capturing the relationships between individual attributes and the prediction. NN-MCDA uses a linear component (in an additive form of a set of polynomial functions) to characterize such relationships through providing explicit non-monotonic marginal value functions, and a nonlinear component (in a standard multilayer perceptron form) to capture the implicit high-order interactions among attributes and their complex nonlinear transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NN-MCDA with extensive simulation studies and three real-world datasets. The study sheds light on how to improve the prediction performance of MCDA models using machine learning techniques, and how to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models using MCDA approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Natural and environmental sciences are one of the scientific domains which seek a lot of attention as it requires high performance computation and large storage space. Cloud computing is such a platform that offers a customizable infrastructure where scientific applications can provision the required resources prior to execution. The elasticity characteristic of cloud computing and it’s pay-as-you-go pricing model can reduce the resource usage cost for cloud client’s. The various services offered by the cloud providers and the extravagant developments in the domain of cloud computing has attracted many scientists to deploy their applications on cloud. The change in number of tasks of scientific application directly affects the demand of cloud resources. Therefore, to handle the fluctuating demand of resources, there is a need to manage the resources in an efficient manner. This research work focuses on the design of a prediction based scheduling approach which maps the tasks of scientific application with the optimal VM by combining the features of swarm intelligence and multi-criteria decision making approach. The proposed approach improves the accuracy rate, minimizes the execution time, cost and service level agreement violation rate in comparison to existing scheduling heuristics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This work developed models to identify optimal spatial distribution of emergency evacuation centers (EECs) such as schools, colleges, hospitals, and fire stations to improve flood emergency planning in the Sylhet region of northeastern Bangladesh. The use of location-allocation models (LAMs) for evacuation in regard to flood victims is essential to minimize disaster risk. In the first step, flood susceptibility maps were developed using machine learning models (MLMs), including: Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation (LM-BP) neural network and decision trees (DT) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. Performance of the MLMs and MCDM techniques were assessed considering the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Mathematical approaches in a geographic information system (GIS) for four well-known LAM problems affecting emergency rescue time are proposed: maximal covering location problem (MCLP), the maximize attendance (MA), p-median problem (PMP), and the location set covering problem (LSCP). The results showed that existing EECs were not optimally distributed, and that some areas were not adequately served by EECs (i.e., not all demand points could be reached within a 60-min travel time). We concluded that the proposed models can be used to improve planning of the distribution of EECs, and that application of the models could contribute to reducing human casualties, property losses, and improve emergency operation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Treatment planning for prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can take 5–30 min per plan to optimize and calculate, limiting the number of plan options that can be explored before the final plan decision. Inspired by the speed and accuracy of modern machine learning models, such as residual networks, we hypothesized that it was possible to use a machine learning model to bypass the time-intensive dose optimization and dose calculation steps, arriving directly at an estimate of the resulting dose distribution for use in multi-criteria optimization (MCO). In this study, we present a novel machine learning model for predicting the dose distribution for a given patient with a given set of optimization priorities. Our model innovates upon the existing machine learning techniques by utilizing optimization priorities and our understanding of dose map shapes to initialize the dose distribution before dose refinement via a voxel-wise residual network. Each block of the residual network individually updates the initialized dose map before passing to the next block. Our model also utilizes contiguous and atrous patch sampling to effectively increase the receptive fields of each layer in the residual network, decreasing its number of layers, increasing model prediction and training speed, and discouraging overfitting without compromising on the accuracy. For analysis, 100 prostate VMAT cases were used to train and test the model. The model was evaluated by the training and testing errors produced by 50 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation, with 100 cases randomly shuffled into the subsets at each iteration. The error of the model is modest for this data, with average dose map root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 2.38 ± 0.47% of prescription dose overall patients and all optimization priority combinations in the patient testing sets. The model was also evaluated at iteratively smaller training set sizes, suggesting that the model requires between 60 and 90 patients for optimal performance. This model may be used for quickly estimating the Pareto set of feasible dose objectives, which may directly accelerate the treatment planning process and indirectly improve final plan quality by allowing more time for plan refinement. © Copyright © 2021 Jensen, Zhang, Koontz and Wu.},

abstract={As an alternative centralized systems, which may prevent data to be stored in a central repository due to its privacy and/or abundance, federated learning (FL) is nowadays a game changer addressing both privacy and cooperative learning. It succeeds in keeping training data on the devices, while sharing locally computed then globally aggregated models throughout several communication rounds. The selection of clients participating in FL process is currently at complete/quasi randomness. However, the heterogeneity of the client devices within Internet-of-Things environment and their limited communication and computation resources might fail to complete the training task, which may lead to many discarded learning rounds affecting the model accuracy. In this article, we propose FedMCCS, a multicriteria-based approach for client selection in FL. All of the CPU, memory, energy, and time are considered for the clients resources to predict whether they are able to perform the FL task. Particularly, in each round, the number of clients in FedMCCS is maximized to the utmost, while considering each client resources and its capability to successfully train and send the needed updates. The conducted experiments show that FedMCCS outperforms the other approaches by: 1) reducing the number of communication rounds to reach the intended accuracy; 2) maximizing the number of clients; 3) handling the least number of discarded rounds; and 4) optimizing the network traffic. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The selection of an optimal building façade system is a challenging process that can be facilitated by using decision-analysis methods. However, current commonly-used decision-analysis tools in civil engineering cannot deal with the interactions among multiple design criteria. The Choquet integral is the only well-known method capable of accounting for such interactions. However, the process of assigning the fuzzy measures (importance weights) for this method is complex, particularly when there is a large number of criteria be considered. This paper proposes two supervised methods to estimate these fuzzy measures. The first method estimates the relative importance weights by using a statistical approach based on Principal Component Analysis, while the second method is elicited from a machine learning algorithm using Neural Networks. These two methods are used in an illustrative example to find the fuzzy measures related to façade design with respect to four criteria; and their merits and limitations are discussed. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={In this paper, a novel deep neural network-based energy prediction algorithm for accurately forecasting the day-ahead hourly energy consumption profile of a residential building considering occupancy rate is proposed. Accurate estimation of residential load profiles helps energy providers and utility companies develop an optimal generation schedule to address the demand. Initially, a comprehensive multi-criteria analysis of different machine learning approaches used in energy consumption predictions was carried out. Later, a predictive micro-grid model was formulated to synthetically generate the stochastic load profiles considering occupancy rate as the critical input. Finally, the synthetically generated data were used to train the proposed eight-layer deep neural network-based model and evaluated using root mean square error and coefficient of determination as metrics. Observations from the results indicated that the proposed energy prediction algorithm yielded a coefficient of determination of 97.5% and a significantly low root mean square error of 111 Watts, thereby outperforming the other baseline approaches, such as extreme gradient boost, multiple linear regression, and simple/shallow artificial neural network. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The learning of predictive models for data-driven decision support has been a prevalent topic in many fields. However, construction of models that would capture interactions among input variables is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a new preference learning approach for multiple criteria sorting with potentially interacting criteria. It employs an additive piecewise-linear value function as the basic preference model, which is augmented with components for handling the interactions. To construct such a model from a given set of assignment examples concerning reference alternatives, we develop a convex quadratic programming model. Because its complexity does not depend on the number of training samples, the proposed approach is capable for dealing with data-intensive tasks. To improve the generalization of the constructed model on new instances and to overcome the problem of overfitting, we employ the regularization techniques. We also propose a few novel methods for classifying nonreference alternatives in order to enhance the applicability of our approach to different data sets. The practical usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a problem of parametric evaluation of research units, whereas its predictive performance is studied on several monotone classification problems. The experimental results indicate that our approach compares favourably with the classical UTilités Additives DIScriminantes (UTADIS) method and the Choquet integral-based sorting model. Summary of Contribution. The paper tackles vital challenges at the intersections of multiple criteria decision analysis and machine learning, showing how computationally advanced techniques can be used for faithfully representing human preferences and dealing with complex decision problems. Specifically, we propose a novel preference learning method for multiple criteria sorting problems. The introduced approach incorporates convex quadratic programming to construct a value-based preference model based on large sets of preference statements. In this way, we extend the applicability of decision analysis methods to preferences derived from historical data or observation of users’ behavior in addition to the preference judgments explicitly revealed by the decision-makers. The method’s practical usefulness is illustrated on a variety of real-world datasets from fields such as higher education, medicine, human resources, and housing market. Its potential for supporting better decision-making is enhanced by both an interpretable form of the assumed model handling interactions between criteria as well as a high predictive performance demonstrated in the extensive computational experiments.

Digital contact tracing apps like Aarogya setu (India) and Pan-European privacy preserving proximity tracing (German) has somehow helped but they are more effective in the initial stage and less relevant in the community spread phase. Thus, there is a need to devise a Decision Support System (DSS) based on machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we have attempted to propose an Additive Utility Assumption Approach for Criterion Comparison in Multi-criterion Intelligent Decision Support system for COVID-19. The dataset of Covid-19 has been taken from government link for validating the results. In this paper, an additive utility assumption-based approach for multi-criterion decision support system (MCDSS) with an accurate prediction of identified risk factors on certain well-defined input parameters is proposed and validated empirically using the standard SEIR model approach (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered). The results includes comparative analysis in tabular form with already existing approaches to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach including the parameters such as Precision, Recall and F-Score. Other advanced parameters such as, MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient), ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) and PRC (Precision Recall) have also been considered for validation and the graphs are illustrated using Jupyter notebook. The statistical analysis of the most affected top eight states of India is undertaken effectively using the Weka software tool and IBM Cognos software to correctly predict the outbreak of pandemic situation due to Covid-19. Finally, the article has immense potential to contribute to the COVID-19 situation and may prove to be instrumental in propelling the research interest of researchers and providing some useful insights for the current pandemic situation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hazards and disasters have always negative impacts on the way of life. Landslide is an overwhelming natural as well as man-made disaster that causes loss of natural resources and human properties throughout the world. The present study aimed to assess and compare the prediction efficiency of different models in landslide susceptibility in the Kysuca river basin, Slovakia. In this regard, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory combining with the analytic network process (FDEMATEL-ANP), Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier were considered. Initially, a landslide inventory map was produced with 2000 landslide and non-landslide points by randomly divided with a ratio of 70%:30% for training and testing, respectively. The geospatial database for assessing the landslide susceptibility was generated with the help of 16 landslide conditioning factors by allowing for topographical, hydrological, lithological, and land cover factors. The ReliefF method was considered for determining the significance of selected conditioning factors and inclusion in the model building. Consequently, the landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were generated using the FDEMATEL-ANP, Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier models. Finally, the area under curve (AUC) and different arithmetic evaluation were used for validating and comparing the results and models. The results revealed that random forest (RF) classifier is a promising and optimum model for landslide susceptibility in the study area with a very high value of area under curve (AUC = 0.954), lower value of mean absolute error (MAE = 0.1238) and root mean square error (RMSE = 0.2555), and higher value of Kappa index (K = 0.8435) and overall accuracy (OAC = 92.2%). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Road infrastructure performance is closely associated with passengers and freight transportation systems and socio-economic development. The performance of road infrastructure is commonly measured by sensor-monitored indicators, and the ability of monitored indicators in revealing actual performance is generally determined by decision makers and road users. However, it is usually unreliable to directly apply monitored indicators in road performance evaluation, due to the limited aspects of individual sensor-monitored indicators, and potential biases and uncertainties of human experience. To address the issues, this study proposes a model-driven fuzzy spatial multi-criteria decision making (MFSD) approach to derive a comprehensive and accurate indicator of sustainable road performance. In this study, the MFSD approach is applied in exploring the road network in the Wheatbelt region in Western Australia, Australia. Spatial variables of road properties, traffic vehicles and climate conditions are used as criteria in the decision making. Four sensor monitored indicators are collected for estimating contributions of criteria. Results show that the MFSD-based indicator can more comprehensively and accurately characterize sustainable road infrastructure performance. In the study area, the MFSD-based indicator can improve 30.46% of the correlation with road maintenance cost compared with roughness, which is the optimal sensor monitored indicator. At the local government areas, the MFSD-based indicator can explain 45.8% of practical road maintenance cost. Sensitivity analysis from multiple aspects indicates that MFSD is a reliable and accurate method in decision making. The proposed method and analysis have broad potentials in the network-level sustainable infrastructure management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={There has been an increase in the number of video conferencing tools used during the COVID19 outbreak. Video Conferencing has become a more prevalent and reliable tool when traveling, and face-to-face meetings are not an option. Evaluating and choosing the best conferencing tool that meets the requirement of the organization is difficult. A reliable conferencing tool provides the dual benefit of allowing users to communicate effectively with their teams and clients while also making the Information Technology (IT) department's job easier. Choosing an inappropriate conferencing tool may critically affect the functioning and processes of the business. Our study's core purpose is to evaluate and select the video conferencing platform, which is based upon the methodology called Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). Numerous proceedings were considered during the evaluation process, and the best software packages selected were based upon a set of matrix outcomes using Fuzzy AHP. The experimental observation demonstrates that two software packages, zoom, and blue jeans, can give better results based upon their ranking scores among the selected alternatives. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={We contribute MobileVisFixer, a new method to make visualizations more mobile-friendly. Although mobile devices have become the primary means of accessing information on the web, many existing visualizations are not optimized for small screens and can lead to a frustrating user experience. Currently, practitioners and researchers have to engage in a tedious and time-consuming process to ensure that their designs scale to screens of different sizes, and existing toolkits and libraries provide little support in diagnosing and repairing issues. To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and identified five common mobile-friendly issues. MobileVisFixer addresses four of these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across various visualizations and fully explainable. MobileVisFixer deconstructs charts into declarative formats, and uses a greedy heuristic based on Policy Gradient methods to find solutions to this difficult, multi-criteria optimization problem in reasonable time. In addition, MobileVisFixer can be easily extended with the incorporation of optimization algorithms for data visualizations. Quantitative evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. © 1995-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The impact-echo diagnostic method is a well-known nondestructive pulse compression test method, which can be relatively easily used for the testing of concrete and reinforced concrete elements. The evaluation of the measurement with this method is based on the analysis of the signal itself in the time and frequency domains. This allows acquisition of information on the velocity of the mechanical wave, the resonant frequency of the specimen or on the presence of internal defects. The ability to interpret these measurements depends on the experience of the diagnostic technician. The advent of classification algorithms in the field of machine learning has brought an increasing number of applications where the entire interpretation phase can be considerably simplified with the help of classification models. However, this automated evaluation procedure must be provided with the information of whether the signal acquired by the test equipment has actually been measured under optimally set conditions. This paper proposes a procedure for the mutual comparison of different measuring setups with a variable tip type, hammer handle and impact force. These three variables were used for a series of measurements which were subsequently compared with each other using multi-criteria evaluation. This offers a tool for the evaluation of measured data and their filtering. As an output of the designed method, each measurement is marked by a score value, which represents how well the acquired signal fit the weight demands for each observed feature of the signal. The method allows the adjustment of selected demands for a specific application by means of set thresholds. This approach enables the understanding of characteristics of the signal in the automated pre-processing of measured data, where computing power is limited. Thus, this solution is potentially suitable for remote long-term observations with sensor arrays or for acoustic emission signals pre-processing. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={In agriculture, land use and land classification address questions such as “where”, “why” and “when” a particular crop is grown within a particular agroecology. To date, there are several land suitability analysis (LSA) methods, but there is no consensus on the best method for crop suitability analysis. We conducted a scoping review to evaluate methodological strategies for LSA. Secondary to this, we assessed which of these would be suitable for neglected and underutilised crop species (NUS). The review classified LSA methods reported in articles as traditional (26.6%) and modern (63.4%). Modern approaches, including multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods such as analytical hierarchy process (AHP) (14.9%) and fuzzy methods (12.9%); crop simulation models (9.9%) and machine learning related methods (25.7%) are gaining popularity over traditional methods. The MCDM methods, namely AHP and fuzzy, are commonly applied to LSA while crop models and machine learning related methods are gaining popularity. A total of 67 parameters from climatic, hydrology, soil, socio-economic and landscape properties are essential in LSA. Unavailability and the inclusion of categorical datasets from social sources is a challenge. Using big data and Internet of Things (IoT) improves the accuracy and reliability of LSA methods. The review expects to provide researchers and decision-makers with the most robust methods and standard parameters required in developing LSA for NUS. Qualitative and quantitative approaches must be integrated into unique hybrid land evaluation systems to improve LSA. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Crop diversification, both in time and in space, is essential for agroecological pest management. Process-based weed dynamics models are valuable tools to investigate this issue. Indeed, (1) weeds are the most harmful pest in arable crops and are essential for biodiversity, and (2) the processes driving crop-weed interactions are similar to those for crop-crop interactions in crop mixtures and crop rotations. Such models (3) synthesize existing and produce emergent knowledge on agroecological levers such as crop diversification, (4) mobilize this knowledge for cropping-system design, and (5) transfer research-based knowledge to stakeholders. The present paper illustrates these five items with the FLORSYS model. Its inputs are a detailed list of cultural operations over several years (crop succession including cover crops and crop mixtures, management techniques), together with daily weather data, soil characteristics and a regional weed species pool. FLORSYS runs at a daily time step, (1) focusing on processes leading to plant emergence and establishment of crop and weed species with different ecological requirements (essential for crops sown in different seasons and in mixtures where timing often determines the fate of a species), (2) representing and modelling the functioning of heterogeneous crop-weed canopies including diverse plant ages, morphologies and shade responses (as in crop mixtures), (3) including a carry-over effect on future cropping seasons (which is essential for crop rotations), and (4) assessing weed contribution to biodiversity. Detailed biophysical model outputs allow understanding the performance of a given crop, management technique or cropping system. Together with stakeholders, detailed model outputs were aggregated into indicators of crop production as well as weed benefits and harmfulness to simplify the multicriteria comparison of cropping systems. To facilitate decision support, FLORSYS was used as a virtual farm-field network, and the resulting simulation outputs were aggregated into a faster and easier-to-use metamodel (DECIFLORSYS) using machine learning techniques. These models were used to evaluate and promote the benefits of crop diversification for agroecological weed management, by (1) identifying crop ideotypes, (2) tracking crop-diverse solutions in farm-field networks, (3) evaluating crop-diverse solutions proposed by experts and stakeholders, and (4) feeding participatory workshops with farmers.

abstract={Vis-NIRS, MIRS, and a combination of both coupled with PLS and machine learning were applied to i) trace the composed proportions of different apple varieties in formulated purees and ii) predict the quality characteristics of formulated purees from spectral information of initial puree cultivars. The PLS models could estimate proportions of each apple cultivar in puree mixtures using MIR spectra (RMSEP<8.1%, RPD> 3.6), especially for Granny Smith (RMSEP = 2.7%, RPD = 11.4). The concentration profiles from multivariate curve resolution-alternative least squares (MCR-ALS) made possible to reconstruct spectra of formulated purees. MIRS technique was evidenced to predict the final puree quality, such as viscosity (RPD>4.0), contents of soluble solids (RPD = 4.1), malic acid (RPD = 4.7) and glucose (RPD = 4.3), based only on the spectral data of composed puree cultivars. Infrared technique should be a powerful tool for puree traceability, even for multicriteria optimization of final products from the characteristics of composed puree cultivars before formulation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Multi-task learning is a promising machine learning branch, which aims to improve the generalization of the prediction models by sharing knowledge among tasks. Most of the existing multi-task learning methods rely on predefined task relationships and guide the learning process of models by linear regularization terms. On the one hand, improper setting of task relationships may result in negative knowledge transfer; on the other hand, these methods also suffer from the insufficiency of representation ability. To overcome these problems, this paper focuses on attention-based deep multi-task learning method, and provides a novel deep multi-task learning method, namely, Deep Multi-task Learning with Relational Attention (DMLRA). In particular, we first provide a task-specific attention module to specify features for different learning tasks, because different prediction tasks may rely on different parts of the shared feature set. Then, we design a relational attention module to learn relationships among multiple tasks automatically, and transfer positive and negative knowledge among multiple tasks accordingly. Moreover, we provide a joint deep multi-task learning framework to combine task-specific module and relational attention module. Finally, we apply our method on a multi-criteria business success assessment problem, both classical and the state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods are employed to provide baseline performance. The experiments are conducted on real-world datasets, results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing methods. © 2020},

abstract={Soil erosion by water and other anthropogenic activities in the semi-arid and humid region is noticed as a major issue in the reduction in natural land by the loss of soil nutrients. The seven standard parameters were suggested in the literature for the assessment of soil erosion hazard, viz. soil loss, sediment yield, run-off potential, land capability class, drainage density, sediment transport index, and slope. In the present study, the combination of intelligent vulnerability prediction, multi-criteria decision-making, and geographic information system techniques provides an effective approach to identify the soil erosion hazard in the semi-arid and humid region. It makes this process more effective and efficient as the vulnerability of soil erosion hazard can be predicted by the proposed trained models for any locations that have the streamlined values of above seven parameters as suggested in this paper. The standard machine learning classifiers such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, random forest (RF), multinomial naive bays, adaptive boosting, and gradient adaptive boosting (GAB) have been applied on the spatial data set of “Pairi” river watershed found in “Chhattisgarh”, India. There are five categories of soil abrasion, viz. “very low”, “low”, “medium”, “high”, and “very high”, in this data set that represents an index of soil erosion hazard. The experimental results have given 91.5140% and 90.5525% accuracy using RF and GAB, respectively, whereas a much better log-loss measure, i.e. 0.27, is obtained by the GAB in comparison of 0.93 with RF. The results have been verified by visiting the ground truth locations. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Brands are introduced by the companies to create an identity for their products or services. Brand ambassadors play a vital role in creating reach and awareness among the customers about the brand. The ambassadors are chosen in a way such that they can leverage their existing fan base. Ambassadors are selected by the companies based on important criteria like their personality resonance with the brand and their potential to influence customers through their social media profiles. Owing to the increase in social media users across the globe, reaching the customers through social media seems promising and profitable. In this study we are proposing a brand ambassador selection tool that uses a logistic regression classification model to quantify the personality dimensions based on Aaker’s brand personality model for which the tweets of the brand and the ambassadors are used as input. Our constructed machine-learning model shows 94% accuracy. Then, a multi-criteria decision-making approach with Analytical Hierarchical Processing (AHP) is used to find the best suited ambassador for a brand using the output obtained from the devised machine learning model as input. This tool will help the companies to select their brand ambassadors accurately with least cost and real time data. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={Purpose: This paper presents an algorithm that can elicitate all or any combination of parameters for the ELECTRE II, III or IV, methods. The algorithm takes some steps of a machine learning ensemble technique, the random forest, and for that, the authors named the approach as Ranking Trees Algorithm. Design/methodology/approach: First, for a given method, the authors generate a set of ELECTRE models, where each model solves a random sample of criteria and actions (alternatives). Second, for each generated model, all actions are projected in a 1D space; in general, the best actions have higher values in a 1D space than the worst ones; therefore, they can be used to guide the genetic algorithm in the final step, the optimization phase. Finally, in the optimization phase, each model has its parameters optimized. Findings: The results can be used in two different ways; the authors can merge all models, to find the elicitated parameters in this way, or the authors can ensemble the models, and the median of all ranks represents the final rank. The numerical examples achieved a Kendall Tau correlation rank over 0.85, and these results could perform as well as the results obtained by a group of specialists. Originality/value: For the first time, the elicitation of ELECTRE parameters is made by an ensemble technique composed of a set of uncorrelated multicriteria models that can generate robust solutions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The proposed approach is independent of the intra-domain forwarding, so it may be useful for a number of different scenarios of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles connectivity (e.g., a swarm of drones). In the implementation developed in this paper, the connection is served by three different mobile network operators in order to ensure reliable connectivity. The proposed algorithm makes use of Machine Learning tools that are properly trained for predicting the behavior of the link connectivity during the flight duration.

abstract={Resilience is the system ability to adjust its functioning prior to, during, or following changes and perturbations. Resilience Engineering represents a new paradigm to improve safety, focusing on how to create resilience in systems. The resilience measurement supports decision making processes, but it is not a trivial task. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are: (1) to critically analyze the literature about quantitative resilience assessments in the industrial safety domain, and (2) to propose a novel three-tier approach for measuring and assessing the resilience potential in any organization in the same domain. To achieve our objectives, we performed a narrative literature review about the existing approaches, frameworks, and methods quantifying and ranking resilience indicators, and/or estimating an overall resilience score. Multi-Criteria Decision Making and Bayesian Network approaches are frequently employed for such purposes. The results gathered through the narrative review represent a key source for developing a novel tiered approach. We propose an approach able to quantitatively assess the resilience potential in the industrial safety domain that consists of three tiers. A knowledge-driven tier assesses resilience by using the knowledge of decision makers through techniques involving judgements, a knowledge and data-driven tier incorporates methods considering both expert knowledge under uncertainty and objective data, while a data-driven tier includes models performing resilience assessments entirely based on data provided by devices and information systems in the organization. © ESREL 2021.

abstract={The selection of Maintenance Significant Items (MSI) is a very important phase in the implementation of Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) in any organization, being essentially a screening phase in which the number of items for analysis can be reduced and prioritized. Despite its importance, there are currently few studies that present systematic and structured methods for MSI identification. There are two phases to identify these items in a physical asset portfolio: firstly, based on the system study and analysis, the criteria and scales are established; secondly, the criteria evaluation for each item is performed. In the latter phase, generally, a Multicriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method is used to rank the MSI. However, their intrinsic subjective evaluation can lead to bias results. To prevent this issue and simplify the process, this work proposes the use of an unsupervised method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). With this method application, not only the MSI of a system are defined, but also the importance of the criteria selected in the first phase is assessed based on the variability of the scores associated with each item. To demonstrate the method, it is implemented considering data from a hydroelectric power plant, and the results are compared to those obtained from a more traditional approach.

abstract={Multicriteria recommender systems are widely used in all sectors of industries. Examples of recommender systems include Netflix’s recommendation machine, Amazon’s recommender machines, etc. They help people to take informed decisions. There are many research activities taking place in the recommender system field. In this research activity we discuss the performance of a multicriteria recommender system using different kinds of machine learning and deep learning approaches. We explain in depth about the need for a recommender system, and then discuss the history of recommender systems. We also discuss the different types of filtering techniques and phases of a multicriteria recommender system, and discuss many research activities conducted by researchers around the globe. Then, we describe in depth two machine learning classification approaches and a deep learning approach, which we have implemented in a recommender system. We also show how we have obtained our data set. A comparison table which contains the accuracy and other scores of three different approaches is illustrated, from this table we can easily determine which approach works better in the terms of accuracy, giving the correct recommendations. By following these steps, we were finally able to fulfill our goal. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Interpretability is a desirable property for machine learning and decision models, particularly in the context of safety-critical applications. Another most desirable property of the sought model is to be unique or identifiable in the considered class of models: the fact that the same functional dependency can be represented by a number of syntactically different models adversely affects the model interpretability, and prevents the expert from easily checking their validity. This paper focuses on the Choquet integral (CI) models and their hierarchical extensions (HCI). HCIs aim to support expert decision making, by gradually aggregating preferences based on criteria; they are widely used in multi-criteria decision aiding and are receiving interest from the Machine Learning community, as they preserve the high readability of CIs while efficiently scaling up w.r.t. the number of criteria. The main contribution is to establish the identifiability property of HCI under mild conditions: two HCIs implementing the same aggregation function on the criteria space necessarily have the same hierarchical structure and aggregation parameters. The identifiability property holds even when the marginal utility functions are learned from the data. This makes the class of HCI models a most appropriate choice in domains where the model interpretability and reliability are of primary concern.

abstract={Machine learning techniques have been applied in malware detection widely. Variants or zero-day malwares might escape the detection of passive learning models. The annotation would be time-consuming and laborious if we maintain a passive learning model through updating its training data manually. To make the maintenance become automated and less-annotation-required, this paper proposes an active learning approach for malware detection. As the core of active learning, a selector is designed to select incremental training samples from open environment. It uses multiple criterions, including age, uncertainty, informativity and diversity of Portable Executable (PE) files, for selecting critical samples. We also evaluated the all-round static features of PE files for malicious detection and adopted 973-dim features according to their importance. Experimental results shows that the proposed active learning approach requires very less annotated training samples than passive learning methods, achieving high accuracy and efficiency. Existing sampling strategies using single criterion were also compared experimentally and performed inferior to this method. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper deals with making decisions in local government units in the case of evaluating the projects of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the city of Zabok. There are 18 active NOGs in the city and they send their proposals to the city and depending on the quality of the proposals, the city determines the budget size they will fund. There are 17 criteria in the process of evaluation. The process requires the participation of experts that are capable of evaluation, and the city faces certain issues regarding the experts: it is hard to find them, and there is no budget to pay them. Additionally, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods used in the process of evaluation are complex, and the process is time-consuming. In this paper, the combined MCDM & machine learning approach is used. There are several benefits of using the proposed approach. The approach applies long-term knowledge about the applicants in the evaluation of projects which is in the line with the rules of the public call. Also, the number of experts is now decreased since the neural network contains experts0 knowledge. © 2021 Samo Drobne – Lidija Zadnik Stirn – Mirjana Kljajić Borštnar – Janez Povh – Janez Žerovnik},

abstract={This study introduces a general procedure to analyze the structural vulnerability of large areas applied to an unusual problem. Thus, the vulnerability of a whole neighborhood to two simultaneous extreme events has been analyzed. For this task, the Multi-Criteria Decision Making analysis based on experts' judgment has been an excellent option to be used, but it has some drawbacks. For example, it is difficult to make a judgment for every house, especially when there are uncommon problems. Then, freeware has been used for Machine Learning (ML) methods in order to induce every building's performance. Moreover, in order to have a more accurate result in ML, case-based decision theory has been studied to help experts by creating structural analyses‟ examples of vulnerability levels. Finally, the Fuzzy Logic Method has been employed to convert the criteria results into smoother numerical levels and to include the uncertainty of experts' judgments. Therefore, an algorithm that includes the interaction with the experts has been developed. Here, the justification for using all those procedures is shown, and it is also demonstrated that they can be applied with freeware. © 2021 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.},

abstract={Now-days manufacturing is going more complex, dynamic and changing over time even chaotic in the extended value chain. In order to being able to satisfy the demand for high-quality products in an efficient manner, it is essential to use modern technologies based on AI. These areas, which have great developments are expert systems and machine learning. These have the new challenges to manage the manufacturing in different application areas. There are different possibilities and different approaches for solving multi criteria based engineering tasks, influencing directly to the performance in a workplace. How to combine and use them to improve and manage the performance of the production process in the workplace is a main objective of the current article. The integration of the AI models with FBM templates and libraries can also give a great advantage to standardize the way of decision making in a certain product family (like injection moulds). In the article, the models from both categories considered with tooling questions have been examined. This can help improve manufacturing consistency and reduce the tool inventory by setting shop tool standards for similar operations. © 2021 Danube Adria Association for Automation and Manufacturing, DAAAM.

abstract={In machine learning, the presence of a large number of explanatory features leads to a greater complexity of the algorithms and to a strong degradation in the performance of the prediction models. For this, a selection of an optimal discriminating subset is necessary. Feature selection can be viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem, since, in the simplest case, it involves feature subset size minimization and performance maximization. In our work, we introduced approaches based on the theory of preordering that use association techniques between two heterogeneous features, introduced by S.Chah, H. Chamla1 [14], and between several ones, the first approach consists in selecting at each step a variable by maximizing two criteria, eliminating the effect of the variable in question, and moving on to the next step, the procedure stops when the second criterion is no longer significant. In the second approach, we adapted SFFS (Sequential Floating Forward Selection) and SFBS (Sequential Floating Backward Selection) to our problem. These methods consist of using the SFS (Sequential Forward Selection) algorithm once so as to add 1 features, then using the SBS (Sequential Backward Selection) algorithm for r times in order to remove r features. These steps are then repeated until the stop criterion is obtained. As the optimal values of these parameters cannot be determined theoretically, we proposed to leave them floating during the selection process in order to get as close as possible to the optimal solution. The proposed approaches were tested on several datasets and the experimental results were very satisfactory. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditional methods for requirements prioritization (RP) are currently limited by scalability and lack of automation issues. In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in different areas of software engineering (e.g., requirements analysis, testing, maintenance). In particular, I have found thirteen RP methods applying AI techniques such as machine learning, or genetic algorithms. 38% of these approaches seek to improve the scalability problem, whereas only 15% of them aim to improve the automation aspect along the RP process. Moreover, all these studies have carried out their evaluations with a number of requirements no greater than 100.In order to address the issues of scalability and lack of automation in RP, the present research project aims to propose a semi-automatic multiple-criteria prioritization method for functional and non-functional requirements of software projects developed within the Software Product-Lines paradigm. The proposed RP method will be based on the combination of Natural Language Processing techniques and Machine Learning algorithms, and for its validation, empirical studies will be carried out with real web-based geographic information systems (GIS). This paper describes the problem and technical challenges to be addressed, the related works, as well as the main contributions of the proposed solution. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Generating the overall assessments of cases from their observations on multiple criteria when large volumes of historical data have been accumulated is a key issue. This study, therefore, developed the framework of multi-criteria appraisal recommendation (MCAR). Five strategies belonging to three categories were designed to recommend the overall appraisals of new cases from their observations on multiple criteria based on relevant historical data. The proposed framework’s basic conditions and key issues were presented to widen its application. The framework was then used to generate the diagnostic recommendations for thyroid nodules from their observations based on the historical examination reports of six radiologists. The experimental results indicated that different strategies are appropriate for different radiologists, and no single strategy was found to be the most appropriate for all considered radiologists. The five strategies were compared with four representative machine learning models to highlight their performances and interpretabilities using the historical examination reports of the radiologists. © Operational Research Society 2022.},

abstract={Distance metrics are at the core of many processing and machine learning algorithms. In many contexts, it is useful to compute the distance between data using multiple criteria. This naturally leads to consider vector-valued metrics, in which the distance is no longer a real positive number but a vector. In this paper, we propose a principled way to combine several metrics into either a scalar-valued or vector-valued metric. We illustrate our framework by reformulating the popular structural similarity (SSIM) index and a simple case of the Wasserstein distance used for optimal transport. © 2021, Institute of Mathematics, Czech Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence techniques, including machine learning models, have led to the expansion of prevailing and practical prediction simulations for various fields. The quality of teachers' performance mainly influences the quality of educational services in universities. One of the major challenges of higher education institutions is the increase of data and how to utilize them to enhance the academic program's quality and administrative decisions. Hence, in this paper, Artificial Intelligence assisted Multi-Objective Decision-Making model (AI-MODM) has been proposed to predict the instructor's performance in the higher education systems. The proposed AI-assisted prediction model analyzes the numerical values on various elements allocated for a cluster of teachers to evaluate an overall quality evaluation representing the individual instructor's performance level. Instead of replacing teachers, AI technologies would increase and motivate them. These technologies would reduce the time necessary for routine tasks to enable the faculty to focus on teaching and analysis. The usage for administrative decision-making of artificial intelligence and associated digital tools. The experimental results show that the suggested AI-MODM method enhances the accuracy (93.4%), instructor performance analysis (96.7%), specificity analysis (92.5%), RMSE (28.1 %), and precision ratio (97.9%) compared to other existing methods. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

A number of 255 flash-flood locations, split into training (70%) and validating (30%) samples, along with 10 predictors were used as input in the five models. The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve and several statistical metrics were used to evaluate the Flash-Flood Potential Index results. LR-WOE and AHP-WOE were the most performant models. Nevertheless, all the applied models performed very well (AUC > 0.85). Further, the FFPSI was determined by integrating the FFPI results into a Flow Accumulation procedure.

abstract={Gully erosion is an erosive process that contributes considerably to the shape of the earth’s surface and is a major contributor to land degradation and soil loss. This study applied a methodology for mapping gully erosion susceptibility using only topographic related attributes derived from a medium-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and a hybrid analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for an order of preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) and compare the results with naïve Bayes (NB) and support vector machine learning (SVM) algorithms. A transboundary sub-basin in an arid area of southern Iraq was selected as a case study. The performance of the developed models was compared using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Results showed that the areas under the ROC were 0.933, 0.936, and 0.955 for AHP-TOPSIS, NB, and SVM with radial basis function, respectively, which indicated that the performance of simply derived AHP-TOPSIS model is similar to sophisticated NB and SVM models. Findings indicated that a medium resolution DEM and AHP-TOPSIS are a promising tool for mapping of gully erosion susceptibility. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Thousands of offshore oil and gas structures worldwide are approaching the end of their operating lifespan. Decommissioning processes are expensive and normally take years to finish as various options need to be analysed based on numerous stakeholders' preferences. Despite recent and significant progress in machine learning and data-driven applications in the oil and gas industry, very little work has been done in the area of using machine learning to inform the decommissioning processes and operations. This can be attributed to the lack of relevant public datasets with sufficient samples. In this paper, we present a new oil and gas decommissioning dataset comprised of 708 real samples extracted from over a hundred company proposals and reports. A supervised learning algorithm was applied to the dataset to predict the decommissioning option. Experiments and results suggest that a machine learning approach can greatly help shorten the traditional analysis process while providing decent accuracy. The classification results of this work serve as a baseline to motivate further experiments and enable the research community to broaden and advance the knowledge in this prominent and timely topic. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={A clear understanding of the spatial distribution of earthquake events facilitates the prediction of seismicity and vulnerability among researchers in the social, physical, environmental, and demographic aspects. Generally, there are few studies on seismic risk assessment in United Arab Emirates (UAE) within the geographic information system (GIS) platform. Former researches and recent news events have demonstrated that the eastern part of the country experiences jolts of 3-5 magnitude, specifically near Fujairah city and surrounding towns. This study builds on previous research on the seismic hazard that extracted the eastern part of the UAE as the most hazard-prone zone. Therefore, this study develops an integrated analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and machine learning (ML) for risk mapping considering eight geospatial parameters-distance from shoreline, schools, hospitals, roads, residences, streams, confined area, and confined area slope. Experts' opinions and literature reviews were the basis of the AHP ranking and weighting system. To validate the AHP system, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) classifiers were applied to the datasets. The datasets were split into 60: 40 ratio for training and testing. Results show that SVM has the highest accuracy of 79.6% compared to DT and RF with a "predicted high"precision of 87.5% attained from the model. Risk maps from both AHP and ML approaches were developed and compared. Risk analysis was categorised into 5 classes "very high,""high,""moderate,""low,"and "very low."Both approaches modelled relatable spatial patterns as risk-prone zones. AHP approach concluded 3.6% as "very high"risk zone, whereas only 0.3% of total area was identified from ML. The total area for the "very high"(20 km2) and "high"(114 km2) risk was estimated from ML approach. © 2021 Diena Al-Dogom et al.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the development of a hybrid recommender system that is able to make recommendations under the limitation of processing small amounts of data with strong intercorrelation.

abstract={From the ad network standpoint, a user’s activity is a multi-type sequence of temporal events consisting of event types and time intervals. Understanding user patterns in ad networks has received increasing attention from the machine learning community. Particularly, the problems of fraud detection, Conversion Rate (CVR), and Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction are of interest. However, the class imbalance between major and minor classes in these tasks can bias a machine learning model leading to poor performance. This study proposes using two multi-type (continuous and discrete) training approaches for GANs to deal with the limitations of traditional GANs in passing the gradient updates for discrete tokens. First, we used the Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training approach and then, an approximation of the multinomial distribution parameterized in terms of the softmax function (Gumble-Softmax). Our extensive experiments based on synthetic data have shown the trained generator can generate sequences with desired properties measured by multiple criteria. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Exceptional Model Mining (EMM) is a local pattern mining framework that generalizes subgroup discovery. In EMM, we look for subsets of objects - subgroups - whose model deviates significantly from the same model fitted on the overall dataset. Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) is an area of Multiple Criteria Decision Making where two or more functions need to be optimized at the same time and the goal is to find the best compromise between the concurrent objectives. We introduce a new model class for EMM in a MOO setting called Exceptional Pareto Front Mining.

abstract={Deep learning (DL) is growing in popularity for many data analytics applications, including among enterprises. Large business-critical datasets in such settings typically reside in RDBMSs or other data systems. The DB community has long aimed to bring machine learning (ML) to DBMS-resident data. Given past lessons from in-DBMS ML and recent advances in scalable DL systems, DBMS and cloud vendors are increasingly interested in adding more DL support for DB-resident data. Recently, a new parallel DL model selection execution approach called Model Hopper Parallelism (MOP) was proposed. In this paper, we characterize the particular suitability of MOP for DL on data systems, but to bring MOP-based DL to DBresident data, we show that there is no single “best” approach, and an interesting tradeoff space of approaches exists. We explain four canonical approaches and build prototypes upon Greenplum Database, compare them analytically on multiple criteria (e.g., runtime efficiency and ease of governance) and compare them empirically with large-scale DL workloads. Our experiments and analyses show that it is non-trivial to meet all practical desiderata well and there is a Pareto frontier; for instance, some approaches are 3x-6x faster but fare worse on governance and portability. Our results and insights can help DBMS and cloud vendors design better DL support for DB users.

abstract={This paper describes the development and validation of landslides susceptibility models for mountainous regions using advanced data mining techniques. The investigation was carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of Naïve Bayes Multinomial (NBM) and Random Trees (RT) in landslide susceptibility mapping. The NBM is an advancement of the frequently used Naïve Bayes classifiers, while the RT was built to overcome the limitations of the traditional forest classifiers. A geospatial database for this investigation comprises 148 landslide locations influenced by ten (10) landslide conditioning factors. The factors (Slope Angle, Slopes Elevation, Slope Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile Curvature, Lithology, Soil type, Stream power index (SPI), Sediment transport index (STI), and Rainfall precipitation) were drawn using a Multi Collinearity Decision Making (MCDM) technique. A Frequency Ratio (FR) analysis was used to obtain the relative significance of the factors in the slides. Predictive models were also developed by quantifying these models using data mining techniques. A section of the entire geospatial data (70%) was used as training datasets, while the remaining part of the data (30%) was used to validate the trained datasets. SVM, RT, and NBM algorithms were used to produce predicted datasets from the training datasets. These predicted datasets were used to develop the Landslides Susceptibility Models. A comparative assessment between the two classifiers against the famous traditional learning algorithm, the Support vector machines (SVM), was conducted. Model performance evaluators such as the AUROC, RSME, F-measure, MAE, and ACC were employed to check the predictive capabilities and accuracies of the models. The indices indicated that the SVM model performed better than the other two algorithms in both training and validation datasets. Further analysis and comparison of the models reveal that the new data mining techniques are reliable for landslide susceptibility. Simultaneously, the traditional algorithm is also useful and remains relevant, especially with similar site conditions. This study has provided insights on better planning and development and provision of mitigation strategies and further analysis on landslides in the study area, particularly in cases of limited data availability. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={This article is intended to assess the flood-induced landslide susceptibility in the Indian state of Assam. This study area has high frequency and severity of landslides that are triggered by heavy rainfall and floods. In order to obtain the results, two machine learning models (XGBoost and DLNN) and one of the fuzzy-multi-criteria decision-making methods (FAHP) were combined with certainty factor (CF) bivariate statistic model. Firstly, 16 landslide predictors and 198 flood-induced landslide locations were prepared, this data set being split into training (70%) and validating data sets (30%). The analysis of the results shows that the region’s most prone to flood-induced landslide occurrence can be found in the southern part, while those less prone to these phenomena are generally located in the northern part of the study area. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve indicator shows that XGBoost-CF is the most performance model (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.977), followed by FAHP-CF (AUC = 0.976), DLNN-CF (AUC= 0.974) and CF (AUC = 0.963). © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The present study investigates the efficiency of using sand crumb rubber mixture for vibration isolation and its prediction using machine learning. Safe disposal of waste rubber from tire industries is a matter of concern due to its detrimental effects. A two-dimensional finite element (FE) analysis was performed in ABAQUS, considering a strip foundation as the source of vibration. The effectiveness of the screening was evaluated by calculating the Amplitude Reduction Factor (Arf) for open and infilled trench (OT and IFT) for different trench geometry (distance from the source, depth and width). In previous studies, modelling such screening problems has mostly been accomplished through regression models. The present study explored the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model since machine learning excels in modelling complex behaviours. The SVR model's optimum parameters were successfully determined by performing a grid search and selecting the best model using the Preferential Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) technique. . © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In order to generate trajectories continuously for serial manipulators with high dimensional degrees of freedom (DOFs) in a dynamic environment, a real-time trajectory planning method based on optimization and machine learning aimed at high dimensional inputs is presented. A learning optimization (LO) framework is established. Multiple criteria are defined to evaluate the performance quantitatively, and implementations with different sub-methods are discussed. In particular, a database generation method based on input space mapping is proposed for generating valid and representative samples. The methods presented are applied on a practical application—haptic interaction in virtual reality systems. The results show that the input space mapping method significantly elevates the efficiency and quality of database generation and consequently improves the performance of the LO. With the LO method, real-time trajectory generation with high dimensional inputs is achieved, which lays the foundation for robots with high dimensional DOFs to execute complex tasks in dynamic environments. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Among natural disasters, drought hits almost half of the world every year, regardless of the climatic zones. Identifying drought vulnerability regions is fundamental to plan and adopt mitigation measures. Here we apply a multi-criteria-based machine learning technique that integrates spatial data for preparing drought vulnerability map of different categories. We adopted remote sensing tools with three machine learning models namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) and their ensembles (i.e. Bagging, Boosting and Stacking), as applied to the northwestern part of Iran as a case study. Various types of geo-environmental factors were considered including meteorological, hydrological, agricultural and socio-economic. The result of the model was evaluated through arithmetic logic values (area under the curve [AUC]) under the receiver operating curve (ROC). Through multi-collinearity test, the prominent causative factors for the occurrences of drought are defined. The AUC value from ROC of SVR-Stacking, RF-Stacking and SVM-Stacking model for training datasets are 0.942, 0.918 and 0.896, respectively. The SVR-Stacking yielded the best result (AUC = 0.94) confirming that SVR serves as a robust model for the preparation of drought susceptibility maps that can be used by governmental and other administrative agencies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The shortest secure path (routing) problem in communication networks has to deal with multiple attack layers e.g., man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, packet injection, packet insertion, etc. Consider different probabilities for each such attack over an edge, probabilities that can differ across edges. Furthermore, a usage of a single shortest paths (for routing) implies possible traffic bottleneck, which should be avoided if possible, which we term pathneck security avoidance. Finding all Pareto–optimal solutions for the multi-criteria single-source single-destination shortest secure path problem with non-negative edge lengths might yield a solution with an exponential number of paths. In the first part of this paper, we study specific settings of the multi-criteria shortest secure path problem, which are based on prioritized multi-criteria and on k-shortest secure paths. In the second part, we show a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an undirected graph G and a pair of vertices (s, t), finds prioritized multi-criteria 2-disjoint (vertex/edge) shortest secure paths between s and t. In the third part of the paper, we introduce the k-disjoint all-criteria-shortest secure paths problem, which is solved in time O(min (k| E|, | E|3 / 2) ). © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The subject of the paper is multicriteria problems that arise when modeling the complex diversification of a centralized pharmacy network. The purpose of the work is to analyze the peculiarities of solving the three-criteria problem of pharmacy network diversification by the method of successive concessions in the MATLAB package. The paper solves the following problems: research of the advantages of the proposed three-criteria model of pharmacy network diversification in relation to the classical two-criteria model of portfolio theory; construction of the relation of dominance on a set of criteria; determination of the area of stability in the space of the parameters of the concessions method; evaluating the effectiveness of the method for problems of different sizes. The following methods are used: classical portfolio theory, multicriteria optimization, the successive concessions method, computer modeling of the Pareto set. The results obtained: a study of the processes of complex diversification of the pharmacy network by building portfolio models and solving the relevant multicriteria problems by the successive concessions method. Acceptable sets and sets of pareto-optimal portfolios for the risk management are graphically found, taking into account the activity of the network itself and the client portfolio. Conclusions: The results of computer modeling and numerical analysis of solutions by sequential concessions will be useful for automating the business processes of pharmacy networks, risk management, analysis of market data to improve their efficiency. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

abstract={This article presents a combination of statistical and discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based features for the identification of epileptic seizures in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. A total of 150 quantitative features are extracted from EEG signals. A multi-criteria hybrid feature selection is proposed by combining six feature ranking methods using the majority voting technique to identify the most relevant EEG markers. Kernel-based support vector machine is used to evaluate the proposed approach along with a hybrid classifier namely support vector neural network (SVNN) which is a combination of support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). For performance evaluation of the proposed method, a benchmarked database is used. A comparative study of various types of SVM and SVNN with ten-fold and hold-out cross-validation techniques is conducted. The highest classification accuracy (CA) of 98.18% and 100% sensitivity is achieved with a fine Gaussian SVM classifier with hold-out data division protocol.

abstract={Optimization of water consumption in agriculture is necessary to preserve freshwater reserves and reduce the environment’s burden. Finding optimal irrigation and water resources for crops is necessary to increase the efficiency of water usage. Many optimization approaches maximize crop yield or profit but do not consider the impact on the environment. We propose a machine learning approach based on the crop simulation model WOFOST to assess the crop yield and water use efficiency. In our research, we use weather history to evaluate various weather scenarios. The application of multi-criteria optimization based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) allows users to find the dates and volume of water for irrigation, maximizing the yield and reducing the total water consumption. In the study case, we compared the effectiveness of NSGA-II with Monte Carlo search and a real farmer’s strategy. We showed a decrease in water consumption simultaneously with increased sugar-beet yield using the NSGA-II algorithm. Our approach yielded a higher potato crop than a farmer with a similar level of water consumption. The NSGA-II algorithm received an increase in yield for potato crops, but water use efficiency remained at the farmer’s level. NSGA-II used water resources more efficiently than the Monte Carlo search and reduced water losses to the lower soil horizons. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In this article, we present an extended data-fitting model which involves different and conflicting criteria, and we propose an algorithm based on a scalarization technique to solve it. Our model integrates in a unique framework three different criteria, namely, a data-fitting term, and the entropy and the sparsity of the set of unknown parameters. This model can be analyzed by means of multiple criteria decision-making techniques. We then validate the proposed modified algorithm using two computational experiments: We analyze the problem of handwritten digit recognition using a logistic regression model and a deep neural network model, respectively. In the final part of the article, we employ this methodology to forecasting instead. Given the importance of forecasting techniques to predict the future, which in turn can lead to positive impacts on firm performance, we propose two numerical experiments focusing on the forecast of the US GDP. In the first one, we proceed by means of a modified iterated function system with grayscale maps-type fractal operator, and, in the second one, we implement a modified neural network-based model.

abstract={The Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud services, web-based software systems, and other wireless sensor devices in the healthcare infrastructure have led to phenomenal improvements and benefits in the healthcare sector. Digital healthcare has ensured early diagnosis of the diseases, greater accessibility, and mass outreach in terms of treatment. Despite this unprecedented success, the privacy and confidentiality of the healthcare data have become a major concern for all the stakeholders. Data breach reports reveal that the healthcare data industry is one of the key targets of cyber invaders. In fact the last few years have registered an unprecedented rise in healthcare data breaches. Hacking incidents and privilege abuse are the most common threats and have exposed sensitive and protected health data. Experts and researchers are working on various techniques, tools, and methods to address the security issues related to healthcare data. In this article, the main focus is on evaluating the impact of research studies done in the context of healthcare data breach reports to identify the contemporary privacy and confidentiality issues of sensitive healthcare data. Analysis of the research studies depicts that there is a need for proactive security mechanisms that will help the healthcare organizations to identify abnormal user behavior while accessing healthcare data. Moreover, studies also suggest that ML techniques would be highly effective in securing the privacy and confidentiality of the healthcare data. Working further on this premise, the present study also proposes a conceptual framework that will secure the privacy and confidentiality of healthcare data proactively. The proposed framework is based on ML techniques to detect deviated user access against Electronic Health Records. Further, fuzzy-based Analytical Network Process (ANP), a multi-criteria decision-making approach, is used to assess the accuracy of the supervised and unsupervised ML approaches for achieving a dynamic digital healthcare data security environment. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

abstract={Landslides are dangerous events which threaten both human life and property. The study aims to analyze the landslide susceptibility (LS) in the Kysuca river basin, Slovakia. For this reason, previous landslide events were analyzed with 16 landslide conditioning factors. Landslide inventory was divided into training (70% of landslide locations) and validating dataset (30% of landslide locations). The heuristic approach of Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL)-Analytic Network Process (ANP) was applied first, followed by bivariate Frequency Ratio (FR), multivariate Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), respectively. The results showed that 52.2%, 36.5%, 40.7%, 50.6%, 43.6% and 40.3% of the total basin area had very high to high LS corresponding to FDEMATEL-ANP, FR, LR, RFC, NBC and XGBoost model, respectively. The analysis revealed that RFC was the most accurate model (overall accuracy of 98.3% and AUC of 97.0%). Besides, the heuristic approach of FDEMATEL-ANP model (overall accuracy of 93.8% and AUC of 92.4%) had better prediction capability than bivariate FR (overall accuracy of 86.9% and AUC of 86.1%), multivariate LR (overall accuracy of 90.5% and AUC of 91.2%), machine learning NBC (overall accuracy of 76.3% and AUC of 90.9%) and even deep learning XGBoost (overall accuracy of 92.3% and AUC of 87.1%) models. The study revealed that the FDEMATEL-ANP outweighed the NBC and XGBoost machine learning models, which suggests that heuristic methods should be tested out before directly applying machine learning models. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Carbon nano tubes (CNT) are the main parts of the electronic devices. Due to high carrier mobility, these devices have very high speed. CNT has a wide range of application in making sensors which can detect different types of diseases, materials, viruses and bacteria. The main problem in the CNT based field effect transistors (CNTFETs) is leakage current. For the reduction of leakage current, high k-gate dielectric are the most suitable materials. The purpose of this research is to find the most suitable high k-gate dielectric for the CNTFETs using Neutrosophic Hypersoft set TOPSIS (NHSS-TOPSIS). Since NHSS-TOPSIS are useful when attributes are more than one and are further bifurcated. The concepts of TOPSIS has practical applications in computational intelligence, machine learning, image processing, neural networks, medical diagnosis, and decision analysis. A practical application for ranking of alternatives with newly developed NHSS-TOPSIS approach is illustrated by a numerical example for CNTFETs. The validity and superiority of NHSS-TOPSIS with existing approaches is also given with the help of a comparison analysis. © 2021},

abstract={In many real-world applications, the problem of machine learning is based on multicriteria. The multicriteria learning process becomes problematic with data classification involving multiple class labels. The multilabel-multicriteria classification (MLMCC) is an emerging research area among the data science community, and it has applications in many domains like sciences, computer vision, government, business, and engineering domains. Most of the existing classification techniques learn single criteria and fail to focus with the multicriteria-based internal information. In order to overcome the above research problem, we propose an expert-based pattern driven multilabel learning algorithms (E-PDMLAs) to handle MLMCC. The whole framework is supported with expert knowledge observed as multicriteria, and it is summarized into three broad categories of linguistic terms, namely, MoreThan(>=), LessThan(<=), and Between(-). Also, the top level of data analytics is to unfold the prescriptive analysis on the data. In this work, prescribing data is supported with linguistic terms, namely, Critical, Feasible, and Strong. In support of E-PDMLA, the data have been preprocessed and prescribed into linguistic terms for the better insight of information. In this paper, we propose a novel automated prescriptive and fuzzy-based preprocessing algorithm (prescriptive fuzzy-based domain data preprocessing technique [PF-DDPT]) for all the above three categories. The experimental study has been carried out with Indian coastal dataset, crop dataset, and breast cancer dataset, and the results have been compared with normal and modeling technique. The analysis manifests the strength of our proposed algorithm (PF-DDPT) over accuracy on preprocessing and prescription based on expert perception. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Sports prediction is becoming popular day by day as a huge amount of data is generated after a single match. The number of methodologies is available for classification of sports data. Machine learning is also one of the best techniques, which obtains good results in sports prediction. In this world of sports, cricket is gaining a huge amount of popularity from the last few decades. The problem of team prediction and winner prediction emerges as one of the challenging tasks in the game of cricket. The winning team combination for the tournament is based on the analysis and evaluation of players from the past study. This type of model builds with several features such as previous record and recent performance of players. The performance analysis of players is a basic problem in every sport including cricket. This performance analysis is used to find the strengths and weaknesses of the players. This work is useful for team management and captain for the selection of players. The prediction of a winner in cricket matches is also one of the complex research problem. Many features are needed for deciding the winner of the match like proper team combination, venue, and weather condition. Cricket is a dynamic game where probability changes with different phases of the game. It is a multi-criteria decision problem. In this paper, the study of some existing methods used for team formation and winner prediction in cricket is done. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: In the cold supply chain (SC), effective risk management is regarded as an essential component to address the risky and uncertain SC environment in handling time- and temperature-sensitive products. However, existing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches greatly rely on expert opinions for pairwise comparisons. Despite the fact that machine learning models can be customised to conduct pairwise comparisons, it is difficult for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to intelligently measure the ratings between risk criteria without sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, this paper aims at developing an enterprise-wide solution to identify and assess cold chain risks. Design/methodology/approach: A novel federated learning (FL)-enabled multi-criteria risk evaluation system (FMRES) is proposed, which integrates FL and the best–worst method (BWM) to measure firm-level cold chain risks under the suggested risk hierarchical structure. The factors of technologies and equipment, operations, external environment, and personnel and organisation are considered. Furthermore, a case analysis of an e-grocery SC in Australia is conducted to examine the feasibility of the proposed approach. Findings: Throughout this study, it is found that embedding the FL mechanism into the MCDM process is effective in acquiring knowledge of pairwise comparisons from experts. A trusted federation in a cold chain network is therefore formulated to identify and assess cold SC risks in a systematic manner. Originality/value: A novel hybridisation between horizontal FL and MCDM process is explored, which enhances the autonomy of the MCDM approaches to evaluate cold chain risks under the structured hierarchy. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Identification of areas susceptible to floods is an important issue which requires an increased attention due to the changing frequency and magnitude of floods, which is mainly a result of the ongoing climate change and increasing anthropic pressure on the landscape. In this study, the aim was to identify the areas susceptible to floods using and comparing two different approaches, namely the multi-criteria decision analysis-analytical hierarchy process (MCDA-AHP) and the machine learning-boosted classification (BCT) and boosted regression (BRT) tree. The study area was represented by the Topľa river basin, Slovakia. Altogether, seven relevant flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, river network density, distance from river, flow accumulation, curve numbers and lithology as well as flood inventory database consisting of 107 flood locations were used. Based on the results, almost 40% of the study area is characterized by high to very high flood susceptibility using the MCDA-AHP. In case of the BCT and BRT models, the share of high and very high flood susceptibility class on the basin area is 45% and 38%, respectively. Validation of the performed flood susceptibility models confirmed generally higher accuracy of the machine learning models. The accuracy of the MCDA-AHP model was 81.33% while the accuracy of the boosted tree models was 87.70% and 91.42%, respectively, for classification and regression. The results of this study can enhance more effective preliminary flood risk assessment according to the EU Floods Directive. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={In this last chapter, we demonstrate how combining neural networks with continuous logic and multi-criteria decision-making tools can reduce the black-box nature of neural models. We show that nilpotent logical systems studied in the previous chapters offer an appropriate mathematical framework for the hybridization of continuous nilpotent logic and neural models, and help improve the interpretability and safety of machine learning. In this approach, perceptrons model soft inequalities; namely membership functions and continuous logical operators. We design the network architecture before training, using continuous logical operators and multi-criteria decision tools with given weights working in the hidden layers. Designing the structure appropriately leads to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters to be learned. Our theoretical basis offers a straightforward choice of activation functions (the cutting function or its differentiable approximation, the squashing function), and it also offers an explanation for the great success of the rectified linear unit (ReLU). In this study, we focus on the architecture of a hybrid model and illustrate the results using practical neural applications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The risk of COVID-19 in higher education has affected all its degrees and forms of training. To assess the impact of the pandemic on the learning of university students, a new reference framework for educational data processing was proposed. The framework unifies the steps of analysis of COVID-19 effects on the higher education institutions in different countries and periods of the pandemic. It comprises both classical statistical methods and modern intelligent methods: machine learning, multi-criteria decision making and big data with symmetric and asymmetric information. The new framework has been tested to analyse a dataset collected from a university students’ survey, which was conducted during the second wave of COVID-19 at the end of 2020. The main tasks of this research are as follows: (1) evaluate the attitude and the readiness of students in regard to distance learning during the lockdown; (2) clarify the difficulties, the possible changes and the future expectations from distance learning in the next few months; (3) propose recommendations and measures for improving the higher education environment. After data analysis, the conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made for enhancement of the quality of distance learning of university students. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Knowledge of the spatial distribution of agricultural crops and crop rotation is necessary for the understanding of the farming practices concerning the long-term sustainability of agricultural production. Agricultural crops are increasingly subject to drought due to the effects of global climate change, and the same is true for Croatia due to the constant rise in mean annual temperatures and uneven rainfall distribution. Remote sensing methods have proven to be superior in the detection and monitoring of drought compared to conventional methods of observation from meteorological stations. Information on the condition of crops in the early stages of development indicates potential irregularities in the development of agricultural crops. The objective of this paper is to provide a perspective for the application of remote sensing in crop management using state-of-the-art methods. Analysis of the possible implementation of these methods in Croatia was performed on a macro-and micro-level. Spatial classification, cropland suitability multicriteria analysis, drought assessment, weed detection and crop density calculation were evaluated according to the necessary equipment and data processing segments. Remote sensing application in crop management offers a potential basis for better crop management both at the macro-level for land use planning and at the micro-level for family farms. © 2021, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Agriculture.

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder is a mental disorder that afflicts millions of people worldwide. It is estimated that one in 160 children has traces of autism, with five times the higher prevalence in boys. The protocols for detecting symptoms are diverse. However, the following are among the most used: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), of the American Psychiatric Association; the Revised Autistic Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-R); the Autistic Diagnostic Interview (ADI); and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10), published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and adopted in Brazil by the Unified Health System (SUS). The application of machine learning models helps make the diagnostic process of Autism Spectrum Disorder more precise, reducing, in many cases, the number of criteria necessary for evaluation, denoting a form of attribute engineering (feature engineering) efficiency. This work proposes a hybrid approach based on machine learning algorithms' composition to discover knowledge and concepts associated with the multicriteria method of decision support based on Verbal Decision Analysis to refine the results. Therefore, the study has the general objective of evaluating how the mentioned hybrid methodology proposal can make the protocol derived from ICD-10 more efficient, providing agility to diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder by observing a minor symptom.

abstract={Background: Between 2013 and 2015, the UK Biobank collected accelerometer traces from 103,712 volunteers aged between 40 and 69 years using wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers for 1 week. This data set has been used in the past to verify that individuals with chronic diseases exhibit reduced activity levels compared with healthy populations. However, the data set is likely to be noisy, as the devices were allocated to participants without a set of inclusion criteria, and the traces reflect free-living conditions. Objective: This study aims to determine the extent to which accelerometer traces can be used to distinguish individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from normoglycemic controls and to quantify their limitations. Methods: Machine learning classifiers were trained using different feature sets to segregate individuals with T2D from normoglycemic individuals. Multiple criteria, based on a combination of self-assessment UK Biobank variables and primary care health records linked to UK Biobank participants, were used to identify 3103 individuals with T2D in this population. The remaining nondiabetic 19,852 participants were further scored on their physical activity impairment severity based on other conditions found in their primary care data, and those deemed likely physically impaired at the time were excluded. Physical activity features were first extracted from the raw accelerometer traces data set for each participant using an algorithm that extends the previously developed Biobank Accelerometry Analysis toolkit from Oxford University. These features were complemented by a selected collection of sociodemographic and lifestyle features available from UK Biobank. Results: We tested 3 types of classifiers, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) close to 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87) for all 3 classifiers and F1 scores in the range of 0.80-0.82 for T2D-positive individuals and 0.73-0.74 for T2D-negative controls. Results obtained using nonphysically impaired controls were compared with highly physically impaired controls to test the hypothesis that nondiabetic conditions reduce classifier performance. Models built using a training set that included highly impaired controls with other conditions had worse performance (AUC 0.75-0.77; 95% CI 0.74-0.78; F1 scores in the range of 0.76-0.77 for T2D positives and 0.63-0.65 for controls). Conclusions: Granular measures of free-living physical activity can be used to successfully train machine learning models that are able to discriminate between individuals with T2D and normoglycemic controls, although with limitations because of the intrinsic noise in the data sets. From a broader clinical perspective, these findings motivate further research into the use of physical activity traces as a means of screening individuals at risk of diabetes and for early detection, in conjunction with routinely used risk scores, provided that appropriate quality control is enforced on the data collection protocol. © Benjamin Lam, Michael Catt, Sophie Cassidy, Jaume Bacardit, Philip Darke, Sam Butterfield, Ossama Alshabrawy, Michael Trenell, Paolo Missier.},

abstract={In the recent times, the use of geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) technology has become popular for constructing safe and sustainable pavement structures. The strength of the subgrade soil is routinely assessed in terms of its California bearing ratio (CBR). However, in the past, no effort was made to develop a method for evaluating the CBR of the reinforced subgrade soil. The main aim of this paper is to explore and appraise the competency of the several intelligent models such as artificial neural network (ANN), least median of squares regression, Gaussian processes regression, elastic net regularisation regression, lazy K-star, M-5 model trees, alternating model trees and random forest in estimating the CBR of reinforced soil. For this, all the models were calibrated and validated using the reliable pertinent historical data. The prognostic veracity of all the tools mentioned supra were assessed using the well-established traditional statistical indices, external model evaluation technique, multi-criteria assessment approach and independent experimental dataset. Due to the overall excellent performance of ANN, the model was converted into a trackable functional relationship to estimate the CBR of reinforced soil. Finally, the sensitivity analysis was performed to find the strength and relationship of the used parameters on the CBR value. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper presents an algorithm that can elicitate (infer) all or any combination of elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE) Tri-B parameters. For example, a decision maker can maintain the values for indifference, preference and veto thresholds, and the study’s algorithm can find the criteria weights, reference profiles and the lambda cutting level. The study’s approach is inspired by a machine learning ensemble technique, the random forest, and for that, the authors named the study’s approach as ELECTRE tree algorithm. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors generate a set of ELECTRE Tri-B models, where each model solves a random sample of criteria and alternates. Each sample is made with replacement, having at least two criteria and between 10% and 25% of alternates. Each model has its parameters optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) that can use an ordered cluster or an assignment example as a reference to the optimization. Finally, after the optimization phase, two procedures can be performed; the first one will merge all models, finding in this way the elicitated parameters and in the second procedure, each alternate is classified (voted) by each separated model, and the majority vote decides the final class. Findings: The authors have noted that concerning the voting procedure, nonlinear decision boundaries are generated and they can be suitable in analyzing problems of the same nature. In contrast, the merged model generates linear decision boundaries. Originality/value: The elicitation of ELECTRE Tri-B parameters is made by an ensemble technique that is composed of a set of multicriteria models that are engaged in generating robust solutions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Electronic Health Records (EHRs) hold symptoms of many diverse diseases and it is imperative to build models to recognise these problems early and classify the diseases appropriately. This classification task could be presented as a single or multi-label problem. Thus, this study presents Psychotic Disorder Diseases (PDD) dataset with five labels: bipolar disorder, vascular dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), insomnia, and schizophrenia as a multi-label classification problem. The study also investigates the use of deep neural network and machine learning techniques such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and Decision tree (DT), for identifying hidden patterns in patients' data. The study furthermore investigates the symptoms associated with certain types of psychotic diseases and addresses class imbalance from a multi-label classification perspective. The performances of these models were assessed and compared based on an accuracy metric. The result obtained revealed that deep neural network gave a superior performance of 75.17% with class imbalance accuracy, while the MLP model accuracy is 58.44%. Conversely, the best performance in the machine learning techniques was exhibited by the random forest model, using the dataset without class imbalance and its result, compared with deep learning techniques, is 64.1% and 55.87%, respectively. It was also observed that patient's age is the most contributing feature to the performance of the model while divorce is the least. Likewise, the study reveals that there is a high tendency for a patient with bipolar disorder to have insomnia; these diseases are strongly correlated with an R-value of 0.98. Our concluding remark shows that applying the deep and machine learning model to PDD dataset not only offers improved clinical classification of the diseases but also provides a framework for augmenting clinical decision systems by eliminating the class imbalance and unravelling the attributes that influence PDD in patients. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Covid19 is a horrible disease, which upset our life everywhere. The main complexity of this disease lies in its rapid evolution and through people’s contact and gaps in our understanding. Moreover, it represents critical cases when the immune system has not presented any symptoms. Hence, the design of an effective classifier is necessary. This paper aims to hybrid the multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Pprocess (AHP) tool and the process of the convolutional neural network (CNN), for making the classification of a category of patients. Our novel method is divided into two main phases: the first one focuses on the generation of the priorities of the essential criteria using the AHP model, while the second phase aims to classify the patients using the neural network classifier. In the present study, we considered three important criteria: fever, patient, localiztion, and the age of the patient. From the obtained results, the proposed model has proved its efficiency even if we consider different cases. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Data is evolving with the rapid progress of population and communication for various types of devices such as networks, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), actuators, and sensors. The increment of data and communication content goes with the equivalence of velocity, speed, size, and value to provide the useful and meaningful knowledge that helps to solve the future challenging tasks and latest issues. Besides, multicriteria based decision making is one of the key issues to solve for various issues related to the alternative effects in big data analysis. It tends to find a solution based on the latest machine learning techniques that include algorithms like decision making and deep learning mechanism based on multicriteria in providing insights to big data. On the other hand, the derivations are made for it to go with the approximations to increase the duality of runtime and improve the entire system's potentiality and efficacy. In essence, several fields, including business, agriculture, information technology, and computer science, use deep learning and multicriteria-based decision-making problems.

abstract={The paper presents a novel sensor-based disease symptoms evaluation method which can be applied in the domain of neurological treatment monitoring and efficiency analysis. The main purpose of the method is to provide a quantitative approach for symptoms recognition and their intensity, which can be used for efficient medicine intake planning for Parkinson's Disease patients. This work presents an innovative method, which enables to objectify the process of clinical trials. The developed solution implements sensor data fusion method, which analyses time correlated wearable sensor biomedical data and symptoms survey. We have merged two separate methods of recognizing and assessing the intensity of Parkinson's Disease (PD) symptoms using time-constrained survey as well as sensor and interaction-based algorithms, which enable to objectively assess the intensity of disease symptoms. Based on process-based analysis and clinical trials observations, a set of requirements for validating symptoms of neurological diseases have been formulated. Proposed solution concentrates on PD indicators connected with arms movement and mental reaction delays, which can be registered using wearable sensors. Since 2017 the tool has been tested by a group of four selected neurologists and 10 users, 3 of which are PD patients. To meet the project's supplementary (efficiency, security) requirements, a test clinical trial has been performed involving 3 patients executing trials which lasted two weeks and was supported by the continuous application usage. After successful deployment the method and software tools has been presented for commercial use and further development in order to adjust its usage for other neurological disorders. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Social media networks usage is spreading but accompanied by a new shape of the social engineering attacks in which users’ accounts are compromised by attackers to spread malicious messages for different purposes. To overcome these attacks, authorship verification, a classification problem for classifying a text, whether it belongs to a user or not, is needed. Moreover, the verification must be accurate and fast. Herein, an authorship verification model proposed.

abstract={Purpose: To predict the impact of optimization parameter changes on dosimetric plan quality criteria in multi-criteria optimized volumetric-modulated-arc therapy (VMAT) planning prior to optimization using machine learning (ML). Methods: A data base comprising a total of 21,266 VMAT treatment plans for 44 cranial and 18 spinal patient geometries was generated. The underlying optimization algorithm is governed by three highly composite parameters which model a combination of important aspects of the solution. Patient geometries were parametrized via volume- and shape properties of the voxel objects and overlap-volume histograms (OVH) of the planning-target-volume (PTV) and a relevant organ-at-risk (OAR). The impact of changes in one of the three optimization parameters on the maximally achievable value range of five dosimetric properties of the resulting dose distributions was studied. To predict the extent of this impact based on patient geometry, treatment site, and current parameter settings prior to optimization, three different ML-models were trained and tested. Precision-recall curves, as well as the area-under-curve (AUC) of the resulting receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed for model assessment. Results: Successful identification of parameter regions resulting in a high variability of dosimetric plan properties depended on the choice of geometry features, the treatment indication and the plan property under investigation. AUC values between 0.82 and 0.99 could be achieved. The best average-precision (AP) values obtained from the corresponding precision/recall curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.99. Conclusions: Machine learning models trained on a database of pre-optimized treatment plans can help finding relevant optimization parameter ranges prior to optimization. © 2021 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica},

abstract={Flood risk assessment is an important task for disaster management activities in flood-prone areas. Therefore, it is crucial to develop accurate flood risk assessment maps. In this study, we proposed a flood risk assessment framework which combines flood susceptibility assessment and flood consequences (human health and financial impact) for developing a final flood risk assessment map using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. Two hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, namely ABMDT (AdaBoost-DT) and BDT (Bagging-DT) were developed with Decision Table (DT) as a base classifier for creating a flood susceptibility map. We used 847 flood locations of major flooding events in the years 2007, 2009 and 2013 in Quang Nam province of Vietnam; and 14 flood influencing factors of topography, geology, hydrology and environment to construct and validate the hybrid AI models. Various statistical measures were used to validate the models, including the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve called AUC. Results show that all the proposed models performed well, but the performance of the BDT model (AUC = 0.96) is the best in comparison to other models ABMDT (AUC = 0.953) and single DT (AUC = 0.929). Therefore, the flood susceptibility map produced by the BDT model was used to combine with a flood consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk assessment map for the study area. The final flood risk map can provide a useful source for better flood hazard management of the study area, and the proposed framework and models can be applied to other flood-prone areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

This research work suggests a model for Neural Network Ensemble Machine Learning, Implementation of a series of machine learning algorithms to create an enhanced and efficient predictable solution patients ‘maximum pathological response after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy. The quality of the neural network ensemble framework for machine learning is measured using multicriteria technique of decision making known as simple weighted additive (WSAW). The performance score for WSAW is calculated by taking into account ten measurements, namely accuracy, mean absolute error, root mean square error, TP rate, FP rate, accuracy, recall, F-measure, MCC, and ROC. The results are verified using the technique of cross-validation K-fold to achieve 97.20% accuracy. The findings are quite positive when the execution of the proposed system is coupled with the output of state-of-the-art classificators, for example, Bayes Net, Naïve Bayes, logistic, multilayer perceptron, SMO, voted perceptron, etc. With the increasing trend of artificial intelligence applications in cancer research, machine learning has a great future in forecasting and decision making. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The challenges in decision making can be viewed as selecting an appropriate method from multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). The MCDM methods do not offer similar answers to decision makers. In such cases, selection of the best answer becomes an issue. This is possible when there may be a better choice which was not considered or the unavailability of the right information at that time. MCDM contains a limited number of alternatives for every problem. In the initial process for the solution, all these solutions are explicitly identified. In this work, we have used machine learning techniques to fulfill the objective of MCDM also known as multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). The objective is to rank the movies by using various alternatives based on the weights of several criterions. In this proposed work, different kinds of movies like science fiction, cartoon, and adventures are used to generate the ranking. Other criterions that are used such as various factors like price, movie reviews and duration are used for movie ranking. The movie ranking is generated based on the weightage. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={In this paper a method for optimal location of multi-hubs in a complex network with a large number of nodes is presented. The method is applied to the design of a logistics network composed of many tailings dams and mineral processing plants and combines two data mining techniques, K-Medoids and k-Means, with the multi-criteria decision making model PROMETHEE for the prioritization of nodes to be included into the clusters, based on certain technical and economic decision variables (such as the content of recoverable metals and the costs of transportation). The proposed method contributes to solve a large scale mathematical problem difficult to handle due to the number of variables and criteria. A case study for the recovery of abandoned deposits of mining waste is presented. The case study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed solution and lays the groundwork for further research and other applications of machine learning techniques for big data in support of sustainable production and a circular economy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Perception of treatment effect (TE) in cosmetics is multifaceted and influenced by multiple parameters that need to be considered simultaneously when evaluating TE. Here we provide a global approach to predicting TE perception using Random Forest (RF) classifier. Data from three randomized double-blind clinical studies with a total of 50 subjects were used. Different products were applied to each facial cheek of subjects at each visit, and post-application photographs were taken. Nine primary endpoints relating to skin pores were assessed by a specific image analysis algorithm. Twenty judges evaluated the relative pore visibility in all possible pairs of cheek photographs. RF was used to construct a prediction model for TE perception based on the primary endpoints and judge’s evaluation. Intra-study product ranking was done using the Bradley-Terry model on mean judges’ predicted preference. RF demonstrated overall good accuracy in predicting TE perception. Applying RF technique not only addresses issues of multiplicity, nonlinearity and interactions between multiple criteria but also focuses decision-making on one discrete parameter thereby simplifying interpretability and allowing for more consumer-centered claim substantiation in clinical trials.

Skyline query technique returns a set of interesting objects (skylines) to the user by eliminating objects that are dominated by other objects within the database. Obviously, without doubt streamlining the process of processing skylines in providing answers to user-specified queries is inevitable. In this paper, we proposed SQUiD framework that combines an index-based technique with a prediction method to reduce the computational time for computing skylines over uncertain high-dimensional data. Through experimentations, results obtained clearly demonstrate the superiority of SQUiD framework over SkyQUD framework and BBIS algorithm. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Since the first years of the 90s, recommender systems have emerged as effective tools for automatically selecting items according to user preferences. Traditional recommenders rely on the relevance assessments that users express using a single rating for each item. However, some authors started to suggest that this approach could be limited, as we naturally tend to formulate different judgments according to multiple criteria. During the last decade, several studies introduced novel recommender systems capable of exploiting user preferences expressed over multiple criteria. This work proposes a systematic literature review in the field of multicriteria recommender systems. Following a replicable protocol, we selected a total number of 93 studies dealing with this topic. We subsequently analyzed them to provide an answer to five different research questions. We considered what are the most common research problems, recommendation approaches, data mining and machine learning algorithms mentioned in these studies. Furthermore, we investigated the domains of application, the exploited evaluation protocols, metrics and datasets, and the most promising suggestions for future works. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

In real today a lot of machine analytic techniques available to explore and to investigate the depth knowledge of the dataset but fails to work with multicriteria. There are domains with multicriteria-based decisions like agricultural, spatial, medical, and etc., These domain dataset requires expert intervention as multicriteria to streamline the knowledge presented from the efficient machine learning techniques. The analysis should extend with prescription in order to make productive actions from the learning. This research work is proposed to support the prescription of dataset with a simple automated framework to express the expert percepted value. The simple prescriptive-based domain data preprocessing technique (SP-DDPT) algorithms were defined to support the universal criteria such as ‘less than,’ ‘more than’ and ‘between.’ The proposed framework was applied to the sample Indian coastal dataset and the expert percepted value was preprocessed and prescribed successfully. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Rice is a staple food crop around the world, and its demand is likely to rise significantly with growth in population. Increasing rice productivity and production largely depends on the availability of irrigation water. Thus, the efficient application of irrigation water such that the crop doesn't experience moisture stress is of utmost importance. In the present study, a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network with logistic regression has been used to predict the daily irrigation schedule of drip-irrigated rice. The correlation threshold of 0.75 was used for the selection of features, which helped in limiting the number of input parameters. Also, a dataset based on the recommendation of a domain expert, and another used by the tool Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used for comparison. Field data comprising of weather station data and past irrigation schedules has been used to train the model. Grid search algorithm has been used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. Nested cross-validation has been used for validating the results. The results show that the correlation-based selected dataset is as effective as the domain expert-recommended dataset in predicting the water requirement using LSTM as the base model. The models were evaluated on different parameters and a multi-criteria decision evaluation (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution [TOPSIS]) was used to find the best performing. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The provision of clean and safe drinking water is a crucial task for water supply companies from all over the world. To this end, automatic anomaly detection plays a critical role in drinking water quality monitoring. Recent anomaly detection studies use techniques that focus on a single global objective. Yet, companies need solutions that better balance the trade-off between false positives (FPs), which lead to financial losses to water companies, and false negatives (FNs), which severely impact public health and damage the environment. This work proposes a novel dynamic multi-criteria ensemble selection mechanism to cope with both problems simultaneously: the non-dominated local class-specific accuracy (NLCA). Moreover, experiments rely on recent time series related classification metrics to assess the predictive performance. Results on data from a real-world water distribution system show that NLCA outperforms other ensemble learning and dynamic ensemble selection techniques by more than 15% in terms of time series related F1 scores. As a conclusion, NLCA enables the development of stronger anomaly detection systems for drinking water quality monitoring. The proposed technique also offers a new perspective on dynamic ensemble selection, which can be applied to different classification tasks to balance conflicting criteria. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

This is a preliminary result of executing the high-level cyber threat hunting through automated hypothesis-making and multi-criteria decision making using the binary attack-chaining tables identified in the networks. Firstly, the concepts required for threats modeling and the process of knowledge discovery in databases focused on high-level threat hunting were introduced. After, the knowledge discovered was used in an experiment that applied and evaluated the effectiveness of machine learning and decision-making algorithms in the method proposed to prioritize hypotheses in the screening phase. In addition, an automated hypothesis-making method to be used in production environments was also proposed. Finally, the results achieved in the experiment demonstrated that high-level threat hunting is a viable and more efficient alternative compared to manual process. © 2020 IEEE.},

Various machine learning including deep learning methods find extensive applications in the field of medicine i.e. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) and one of its major examples is detection of cancerous cells. While many such systems explore the idea of classifying the region of abnormality as benign or malign, traditional treatment recommendation solely depends on the knowledge of the physician examining. This paper explores regression using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to pin-point the probable abnormal region in mammograms and calculate several morphological, texture and histogram features associated with it. These features are then leveraged to recommend the next probable treatments. The recommendation is based on the extracted features and therefore constitutes a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. To implement this type of decision making rightfully, the paper makes use of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) where the identified features are used as criteria and experts' opinion are used as alternatives to obtain ranked recommendations. The methodology proposed in the paper is capable of recommending the correct treatment with an accuracy of 81.5%. The proposed methodology would make treatment recommendation reachable even at the most remote places where advanced facilities including consultation with specialists are not easily available. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Diabetes is a matter of concern for the health of the entire world, its diagnosis and cure are among the prime challenge for the medical fraternity, because it can be controlled but can't be cured, sooner the diagnosis the better it will be for the patient. Thus, use of machine learning for timely classification, of diabetes plays a vital role to protect patient from the life threatening complications in future. Various classification techniques are available in Machine Learning (ML) viz. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Linear Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) algorithm, etc. etc. But the question is which of the classification techniques, timely and accurately identifies this sensitive disorder. While predicting Diabetes using any machine learning algorithm, the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity, are some of the important parameters. The strengthening of these parameters requires the understanding of dataset under consideration, i.e. whether the data set is having some missing values or outliers, if missing values exists then to strengthen the prediction accuracy; one has to apply the data imputation techniques on the dataset. In the performed work the well-known dataset (Pima Indian) from UCI repository, was subject to data imputation techniques to handle the missing values present in it(tabulated in Table-1). Thereafter the said Machine Learning techniques were applied, and compared on the basis of various parameters viz. Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity etc., to choose the best among algorithm one has to compare the multiple criteria's altogether, which is quite challenging. Thus, in the performed work the Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) is applied, it is a technique of Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making (MCDM). By applying EDAS over the performance evaluation statistics (speed, accuracy, specificity and sensitivity) of various classification algorithms viz. Naïve Bayes (NB) Classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest(RF), Linear Regression (LR); it is found that the Naïve Bayes (NB) is Ranked as the best Classifier and Random Forest (RF) was the second best ranked alternative for analyzing the PIMA INDIAN DATASET, to predict the diabetes. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent years have shown a significant increase in the occurrence of floods globally, with an impact on habitation and different sectors of the economy. This, in turn, necessitates the use of different flood mitigation strategies, wherein flood vulnerability assessment plays a significant role. The proposed work presents a methodology that combines vulnerability under physical-environmental and socio-economic domains to assess the overall flood vulnerability at the local self-government level. The methodology was illustrated to the case of Aluva municipality, located on the banks of River Periyar, in Kerala state, India. The spatial variation of hazard inducing factors and population statistics were analysed using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. The machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, which uses hazard inducing factors as input was implemented for the evaluation of physical-environmental vulnerability. The social vulnerability of the region was analysed using the GIS Multi-criteria decision analysis approach (MCDA), with criteria weights to incorporate the interests of different stakeholders. The critical combinations of the two domains of vulnerability in the assessment of the vulnerability to flood, to have efficient flood management in local self-government was demonstrated in this study and can be made use of for any flood event. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Discovering association rules is a useful and common technique for data mining, in which relations and co-dependencies of datasets are shown. One of the most important challenges of data mining is to discover the rules of continuous numerical datasets. Furthermore, another restriction imposed by algorithms in this area is the need to determine the minimum threshold for the support and confidence criteria. In this paper, a multi-objective algorithm for mining quantitative association rules is proposed. The procedure is based on the genetic algorithm, and there is no need to determine the extent of the threshold for the support and confidence criteria. By proposing a multi-criteria method, useful and attractive rules and the most suitable numerical intervals are discovered, without the need to discretize numerical values and determine the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold. Different criteria are considered to determine appropriate rules. In this algorithm, selected rules are extracted based on confidence, interestingness, and cosine2. The results obtained from real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The algorithm is used to examine three datasets, and the results show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to similar algorithms. © 2020 Sharif University of Technology.

abstract={Purpose: There is a strong clinical need to evaluate different multi-criteria optimization (MCO) algorithms, including inverse optimization sampling algorithms and machine learning-based predictions. This study aims to develop and compare several interpolated Pareto surface similarity metrics. Materials and methods: The first metric is the root-mean-square error (RMSE) evaluated between vertices on the interpolated surfaces, augmented by intra-simplex sampling of the barycentric coordinates of the surfaces’ simplicial complexes. The second metric is the average projected distance (APD), which evaluates the displacements between the vertices and computes their projections along the mean displacement. The third metric is the average nearest-point distance (ANPD), which numerically integrates point-to-simplex distances over the sampled simplices of the interpolated surfaces. These metrics were compared by their convergence rates, the times required to achieve convergence, and their representation of the underlying surface interpolations. For analysis, several interpolated Pareto surface pairs were constructed abstractly, with one pair from a nasopharyngeal treatment planning case using MCO. Results: Convergence within 1% is typically achieved at approximately 50 and 80 samples per barycentric dimension for the RMSE and the ANPD, respectively. Calculation requires approximately 1 and 10 ms to achieve convergence for the RMSE and the ANPD in two dimensions, respectively, while the APD always requires < 1 ms. These time costs are much higher in higher dimensions for just the RMSE and ANPD. The APD values more closely approximated the ANPD limits than the RMSE limits. Conclusion: The ANPD’s formulation and generality make it likely more meaningful than the RMSE and APD for representing the similarity between the underlying interpolated surfaces rather than the sampling points on the surfaces. However, in situations requiring high-speed evaluations, the APD may be more desirable due to its speed, independence from a subjectively chosen sampling rate, and similarity to the ANPD limits. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine},

abstract={Background: Finding specific scientific articles in a large collection is an important natural language processing challenge in the biomedical domain. Systematic reviews and interactive article search are the type of downstream applications that benefit from addressing this problem. The task often involves screening articles for a combination of selection criteria. While machine learning was previously used for this purpose, it is not known if different criteria should be modeled together or separately in an ensemble model. The performance impact of the modern contextual language models on the task is also not known. Methods: We framed the problem as text classification and conducted experiments to compare ensemble architectures, where the selection criteria were mapped to the components of the ensemble. We proposed a novel cascade ensemble analogous to the step-wise screening process employed in developing the gold standard. We compared performance of the ensembles with a single integrated model, which we refer to as the individual task learner (ITL). We used SciBERT, a variant of BERT pre-trained on scientific articles, and conducted experiments using a manually annotated dataset of ~49 K MEDLINE abstracts, known as Clinical Hedges. Results: The cascade ensemble had significantly higher precision (0.663 vs. 0.388 vs. 0.478 vs. 0.320) and F measure (0.753 vs. 0.553 vs. 0.628 vs. 0.477) than ITL and ensembles using Boolean logic and a feed-forward network. However, ITL had significantly higher recall than the other classifiers (0.965 vs. 0.872 vs. 0.917 vs. 0.944). In fixed high recall studies, ITL achieved 0.509 precision @ 0.970 recall and 0.381 precision @ 0.985 recall on a subset that was studied earlier, and 0.295 precision @ 0.985 recall on the full dataset, all of which were improvements over the previous studies. Conclusion: Pre-trained neural contextual language models (e.g. SciBERT) performed well for screening scientific articles. Performance at high fixed recall makes the single integrated model (ITL) more suitable among the architectures considered here, for systematic reviews. However, high F measure of the cascade ensemble makes it a better approach for interactive search applications. The effectiveness of the cascade ensemble architecture suggests broader applicability beyond this task and the dataset, and the approach is analogous to query optimization in Information Retrieval and query optimization in databases. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Like many other African countries, incidence of drought is increasing in Nigeria. In this work, spatiotemporal changes in droughts under different representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios were assessed; considering their greatest impacts on life and livelihoods in Nigeria, especially when droughts coincide with the growing seasons. Three entropy-based methods, namely symmetrical uncertainty, gain ratio, and entropy gain were used in a multi-criteria decision-making framework to select the best performing General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the projection of rainfall and temperature. Performance of four widely used bias correction methods was compared to identify a suitable method for correcting bias in GCM projections for the period 2010–2099. A machine learning technique was then used to generate a multi-model ensemble (MME) of the bias-corrected GCM projection for different RCP scenarios. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was subsequently computed to estimate droughts from the MME mean of GCM projected rainfall and temperature to predict possible spatiotemporal changes in meteorological droughts. Finally, trends in the SPEI, temperature and rainfall, and return period of droughts for different growing seasons were estimated using a 50-year moving window, with a 10-year interval, to understand driving factors accountable for future changes in droughts. The analysis revealed that MRI-CGCM3, HadGEM2-ES, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, and CESM1-CAM5 are the most appropriate GCMs for projecting rainfall and temperature, and the linear scaling (SCL) is the best method for correcting bias. The MME mean of bias-corrected GCM projections revealed an increase in rainfall in the south-south, southwest, and parts of the northwest whilst a decrease in the southeast, northeast, and parts of central Nigeria. In contrast, rise in temperature for entire country during most of the cropping seasons was projected. The results further indicated that increase in temperature would decrease the SPEI across Nigeria, which will make droughts more frequent in most of the country under all the RCPs. However, increase in drought frequency would be less for higher RCPs due to increase in rainfall. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={A pandemic is a disease that spreads across a large area like multiple continents or worldwide. More than 211 nations are already affected by Covid-19.

Currently coronavirus has no proper treatment in Medical Science, increasing the number of affected people day by day with the number of cases worldwide of novel coronavirus surpassing 1,282,931, with some 72,616 deaths approximately. That is why the main objective of the present investigation is to identify the significant risk factor. Also, in this study we are continuously monitoring the spread of coronavirus. In this study we use a new TOPSIS MCDM approach and GMDH apply to select the significant risk factor and continuous monitoring of death due to Covid-19. Result indicates that “contamination due to contact with the infected person” is the main responsible factor behind the pandemic COVID-19.

To overcome this issue, this study extends the application of the expert system to corporate credit risk and distress prediction through proposing a Multi-criteria Decision Aid (MCDA), namely PROMETHEE II, which provides a multi-criteria evaluation of competing DPMs. In addition, using data on Chinese firms listed on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, we perform an exhaustive comparative analysis of the most popular DPMs; namely, statistical, artificial intelligence and machine learning models under both mono-criterion and multi-criteria frameworks. Further, we address two prevailing research questions; namely, "which DPM performs better in predicting distress?" and "will training models with corporate governance indicators (CGIs) enhance the performance of models?”; and discuss our findings. Our multi-criteria ranking suggests that non-parametric DPMs outperform parametric ones, where random forest and bagging CART are among the best machine learning DPMs. Further, models fed with CGIs as features outperform those fed without CGIs. © 2020},

As a burgeoning emerging market, China has a special policy in treating distressed firms. According to China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), listed firms in the Chinese Stock Exchange will be labeled as “Special Treatment” (ST) in cases when the firm's financial conditions are abnormal (detailed information can be seen in CSRC, 1998). Since firms receiving ST label are mainly due to their financial distress, the problem of predicting if an ordinary company receives ST can be considered as a problem of financial distress prediction (Zhou, 2013b). Therefore, we take ST as a binary response variable that equals 1 for distressed firms and 0 for healthy firms.},

abstract={Feature selection is an important task in machine learning. As multi-label classification tasks appear in various fields, researchers have investigated multi-label feature selection algorithms to reduce data dimensions. Most of the existing wrapper multi-label feature selection algorithms use multi-objective method to obtain the selected features. However, there are multiple criteria to measure the quality of multi-label classification results. In view of this, this study presents a many-objective optimization based multi-label feature selection algorithm (MMFS). To improve the diversity and convergence of NSGA III, we propose an improved NSGA III algorithm with two archives. In this algorithm, new crossover and mutation operators for feature selection are designed to improve the exploration capability, and the influence of the selection threshold θ on feature scale and multi-label classification performance in real number coding is studied. Finally, we conduct experiments on 11 multi-label datasets. The experiments demonstrate that MMFS can balance multiple objectives, remove irrelevant and redundant features, and obtain satisfactory classification results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Similarity measures between Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) play an important role and they have many applications in machine learning and multi-criteria decision making. However, there are few existing similarity measures. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure between Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). We first present a new mathematical formula and then prove that it satisfies all the conditions of similarity measures. The usefulness of the new similarity measure is pointed out by considering a simple classification problem. The results show that the proposed measure can be used to predict the class of a new sample while some of other measures cannot do it. Next, we apply the new similarity measure for solving multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. The results are compared with the ones by using some other similarity measures. The experimentation reports that the new similarity measure may provide different ranking of alternatives but it provides the same optimal solution. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective: To improve patient safety and clinical outcomes by reducing the risk of prescribing errors, we tested the accuracy of a hybrid clinical decision support system in prioritizing prescription checks. Materials and Methods: Data from electronic health records were collated over a period of 18 months. Inferred scores at a patient level (probability of a patient's set of active orders to require a pharmacist review) were calculated using a hybrid approach (machine learning and a rule-based expert system). A clinical pharmacist analyzed randomly selected prescription orders over a 2-week period to corroborate our findings. Predicted scores were compared with the pharmacist's review using the area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve. These metrics were compared with existing tools: computerized alerts generated by a clinical decision support (CDS) system and a literature-based multicriteria query prioritization technique. Data from 10 716 individual patients (133 179 prescription orders) were used to train the algorithm on the basis of 25 features in a development dataset. Results: While the pharmacist analyzed 412 individual patients (3364 prescription orders) in an independent validation dataset, the areas under the receiving-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of our digital system were 0.81 and 0.75, respectively, thus demonstrating greater accuracy than the CDS system (0.65 and 0.56, respectively) and multicriteria query techniques (0.68 and 0.56, respectively). Discussion: Our innovative digital tool was notably more accurate than existing techniques (CDS system and multicriteria query) at intercepting potential prescription errors. Conclusions: By primarily targeting high-risk patients, this novel hybrid decision support system improved the accuracy and reliability of prescription checks in a hospital setting. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

abstract={In this paper, we advance the study of plithogenic hypersoft set (PHSS). We present four classifications of PHSS that are based on the number of attributes chosen for application and the nature of alternatives or that of attribute value degree of appurtenance. These four PHSS classifications cover most of the fuzzy and neutrosophic cases that can have neutrosophic applications in symmetry. We also make explanations with an illustrative example for demonstrating these four classifications. We then propose a novel multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method that is based on PHSS, as an extension of the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). A number of real MCDM problems are complicated with uncertainty that require each selection criteria or attribute to be further subdivided into attribute values and all alternatives to be evaluated separately against each attribute value. The proposed PHSS-based TOPSIS can be used in order to solve these real MCDM problems that are precisely modeled by the concept of PHSS, in which each attribute value has a neutrosophic degree of appurtenance corresponding to each alternative under consideration, in the light of some given criteria. For a real application, a parking spot choice problem is solved by the proposed PHSS-based TOPSIS under fuzzy neutrosophic environment and it is validated by considering two different sets of alternatives along with a comparison with fuzzy TOPSIS in each case. The results are highly encouraging and a MATLAB code of the algorithm of PHSS-based TOPSIS is also complied in order to extend the scope of the work to analyze time series and in developing algorithms for graph theory, machine learning, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence. © 2020, MDPI AG.

abstract={Purpose: Inhomogeneous exposures to ionizing radiation can be detected and quantified with the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) of metaphase cells. Complete automation of interpretation of the DCA for whole-body irradiation has significantly improved throughput without compromising accuracy, however, low levels of residual false positive dicentric chromosomes (DCs) have confounded its application for partial-body exposure determination. Materials and methods: We describe a method of estimating and correcting for false positive DCs in digitally processed images of metaphase cells. Nearly all DCs detected in unirradiated calibration samples are introduced by digital image processing. DC frequencies of irradiated calibration samples and those exposed to unknown radiation levels are corrected subtracting this false positive fraction from each. In partial-body exposures, the fraction of cells exposed, and radiation dose can be quantified after applying this modification of the contaminated Poisson method. Results: Dose estimates of three partially irradiated samples diverged 0.2–2.5 Gy from physical doses and irradiated cell fractions deviated by 2.3%–15.8% from the known levels. Synthetic partial-body samples comprised of unirradiated and 3 Gy samples from 4 laboratories were correctly discriminated as inhomogeneous by multiple criteria. Root mean squared errors of these dose estimates ranged from 0.52 to 1.14 Gy2 and from 8.1 to 33.3%2 for the fraction of cells irradiated. Conclusions: Automated DCA can differentiate whole- from partial-body radiation exposures and provides timely quantification of estimated whole-body equivalent dose. © Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.},

abstract={Finding the precise value of pixel-scale evapotranspiration (ET) for an entire basin is a major challenge to hydrologists. Many efforts have been made to conquer this challenge, among which remote sensing methods are the most promising ones. The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) is one of the several established remote sensing methods to estimate ET. The anchor pixel selection process (e.g., hot and cold pixels) is one of the critical steps in the SEBAL model that also determines the accuracy of the model outputs. Several researchers have improved anchor pixel selection by an automated fashion. In the current study, a new simple method has been proposed to seek the best anchor pixels. Then, the daily ET outputs were assessed using observed data from the Eddy covariance (EC) tower data at Santa Cruz River Watershed for 2014-2015. The results showed that the daily ET with measured data at the study site confirmed our automated anchor pixel selection method to be reliable in terms of selecting appropriate hot and cold pixels under dry conditions by producing ET maps with reasonable accuracies (R2=0.78 and RMSE=0.46 mm day-1). Our study suggests that considerations of simple image-derived parameters, such as temperature difference between hot and cold pixels, distance from a representative station, and elevation differences could improve the automatic selection of anchor pixels and the implementation of the SEBAL model under dry conditions. The machine learning technique could be combined with the proposed automated algorithm to map ET in different climates (not only arid and semiarid) faster and with more accuracy. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Floods are one of the most widespread natural hazards occurring across the globe. The main objective of this study was to produce flood susceptibility maps for the province of Salzburg, Austria, using two multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) models including analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and analytical network process (ANP) and two machine learning (ML) models including random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, we compare which of the MCDA and ML models are better suited for flood susceptibility and evaluate the use of Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) for optimising the resulting flood susceptibility maps based on eleven flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), geology, rainfall, land cover, distance to roads and distance to drainage. The accuracy evaluation of the flood susceptibility maps through the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) method along with the relative flood density (R-Index) shows that RF (AUC = 87.8%) and SVM (AUC = 87%) outperform the ANP (AUC = 86.6%) and AHP (AUC = 85.9%) models. Therefore, the predictive performance of ML models was slightly better than the MCDA models. The DST could further increase the accuracy of both ML models (AUC = 88.3%) and MCDA models (AUC = 87.3%). However, the best accuracy (AUC = 89.3%) is reached through an ensemble of all four models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Context: People who have recently recovered from the threat of deteriorating coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have antibodies to the coronavirus circulating in their blood. Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19. Objective: This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods. Method: The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between ‘serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria’ and ‘patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method’. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix. Result: An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments. Discussion: The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector. © 2020},

abstract={We present a preference learning framework for multiple criteria sorting. We consider sorting procedures applying an additive value model with diverse types of marginal value functions (including linear, piecewise-linear, splined, and general monotone ones) under a unified analytical framework. Differently from the existing sorting methods that infer a preference model from crisp decision examples, where each reference alternative is assigned to a unique class, our framework allows considering valued assignment examples in which a reference alternative can be classified into multiple classes with respective credibility degrees. We propose an optimization model for constructing a preference model from such valued examples by maximizing the credible consistency among reference alternatives. To improve the predictive ability of the constructed model on new instances, we employ the regularization techniques. Moreover, to enhance the capability of addressing large-scale datasets, we introduce a state-of-the-art algorithm that is widely used in the machine learning community to solve the proposed optimization model in a computationally efficient way. Using the constructed additive value model, we determine both crisp and valued assignments for non-reference alternatives. Moreover, we allow the Decision Maker to prioritize the importance of classes and give the method a flexibility to adjust classification performance across classes according to the specified priorities. The practical usefulness of the analytical framework is demonstrated on a real-world dataset by comparing it to several existing sorting methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Influence maximization problem is the procedure of attempting to identify a group of K nodes in a social network in order to maximize the dissemination of influence under certain influence models. Based on state transition algorithm (STA) and a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method called Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), a novel hybrid approach has been proposed to cope with the influence maximization problem in this paper. Firstly, an intelligent optimization paradigm called STA is introduced to obtain the most appropriate weights that are used to integrate the criteria of each alternative in the VIKOR method. Then, a hybrid normalization technique has been presented to allow the process of aggregating criterion with numerical and comparable data properly in this method. Several typical networks have been used to testify the effectiveness of proposed method and technique. Compared with other approaches, experimental results show that our approach can solve the influence maximization problem more effectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In particular, we investigate several different heavily regularized architectures. We find that, contrary to popular belief, neural architectures within this application setting are able to achieve close to human-level performance on unseen test images without requiring large numbers of training examples. Annotating these 3D datasets is difficult, with multiple criteria required. It takes an experienced clinician two days to annotate a single 3D image, whereas our trained model achieves similar performance in less than a second. We found that an approach which uses targeted dataset augmentation, alongside architectural simplification with an emphasis on residual design, has acceptable generalization performance- despite relying on fewer than 15 training examples. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={With an unprecedented combination of mechanical and electrical properties, polymer nanocomposites have the potential to be widely used across multiple industries. Tailoring nanocomposites to meet application specific requirements remains a challenging task, owing to the vast, mixed-variable design space that includes composition (i.e. choice of polymer, nanoparticle, and surface modification) and microstructures (i.e. dispersion and geometric arrangement of particles) of the nanocomposite material. Modeling properties of the interphase, the region surrounding a nanoparticle, introduces additional complexity to the design process and requires computationally expensive simulations. As a result, previous attempts at designing polymer nanocomposites have focused on finding the optimal microstructure for only a fixed combination of constituents. In this article, we propose a data centric design framework to concurrently identify optimal composition and microstructure using mixed-variable Bayesian optimization. This framework integrates experimental data with state-of-the-art techniques in interphase modeling, microstructure characterization and reconstructions and machine learning. Latent variable Gaussian processes (LVGPs) quantifies the lack-of-data uncertainty over the mixed-variable design space that consists of qualitative and quantitative material design variables. The design of electrically insulating nanocomposites is cast as a multicriteria optimization problem with the goal of maximizing dielectric breakdown strength while minimizing dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss. Within tens of simulations, our method identifies a diverse set of designs on the Pareto frontier indicating the tradeoff between dielectric properties. These findings project data centric design, effectively integrating experimental data with simulations for Bayesian Optimization, as an effective approach for design of engineered material systems.

abstract={Estimating parameters for distributed hydrological models is a challenging and long studied task. Parameter transfer functions, which define model parameters as functions of geophysical properties of a catchment, might improve the calibration procedure, increase process realism, and can enable prediction in ungauged areas. We present the function space optimization (FSO), a symbolic regression method for estimating parameter transfer functions for distributed hydrological models. FSO is based on the idea of transferring the search for mathematical expressions into a continuous vector space that can be used for optimization. This is accomplished by using a text generating neural network with a variational autoencoder architecture that can learn to compress the information of mathematical functions. To evaluate the performance of FSO, we conducted a case study using a parsimonious hydrological model and synthetic discharge data. The case study consisted of two FSO applications: single-criteria FSO, where only discharge was used for optimization, and multicriteria FSO, where additional spatiotemporal observations of model states were used for transfer function estimation. The results show that FSO is able to estimate transfer functions correctly or approximate them sufficiently. We observed a reduced fit of the parameter density functions resulting from the inferred transfer functions for less sensitive model parameters. For those it was sufficient to estimate functions resulting in parameter distributions with approximately the same mean parameter values as the real transfer functions. The results of the multicriteria FSO showed that using multiple spatiotemporal observations for optimization increased the quality of estimation considerably. © 2020. The Authors.},

abstract={The study aims to develop a hybrid model approach for the assessment of the landslide (LS) risk qualitatively. It involves multiple consecutive stages of statistical prediction, machine learning, and mapping in the GIS environment. At the first stage, a landslide susceptibility map has been developed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) algorithm, coupled with the binary logistic regression (BLR) technique. The AHP model incorporates 11 geo-hydrological and environmental variables as predictors sourced from remote-sensing datasets to generate the LS susceptibility as output. Twenty-three field-based validation locations validate the test result. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the observed (Ł COMPUTED) and predicted (Ł PREDICTED) values of LS susceptibility is 0.928 at 0.01 level of significance. At the next stage, the LS risk is evaluated considering the ‘risk trio,’ i.e., the combination of the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. This stage involves the transformation of a range of qualitative datasets to the virtual workspace of machine learning. The landslide risk output has been predicted with an initial fuzzy model, incorporating a set of 32 rules for membership functions (MF). This initial model uses randomly selected 20% datasets to tailor the fuzzy rules through the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface (ANFIS). The training to ANFIS results in framing 120 fuzzy rules for the best possible prediction of the outcome. The final LS risk map from the ANFIS output shows that more than 70% area is under high-to-very high LS risk. The model is tested in a 5′ × 5′ grid around the famous hill station Mussoorie in the state of Uttarakhand, India. The model exhibits a satisfactory level of accuracy for the present-study area, which has made us confident to recommend it. The multistage model is worthy of being applied for landslide risk mapping for the similar kinds of study areas, and also for other areas of landslide with necessary customization as deemed necessary. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Nano-lubricant samples are prepared in 0.01–4% nanoparticle volume fraction range. Four machine learning techniques namely decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), generalized linear models and neural network (NN) have been used to predict the kinematic viscosity for Al2O3 and CeO2 nanolubricants. Further, multi-criteria decision-making technique named technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution have been used to find the best predictive method in each category of the nanolubricants.

abstract={Flood is a devastating natural hazard that may cause damage to the environment infrastructure, and society. Hence, identifying the susceptible areas to flood is an important task for every country to prevent such dangerous consequences. The present study developed a framework for identifying flood-prone areas of the Topľa river basin, Slovakia using geographic information system (GIS), multi-criteria decision making approach (MCDMA), bivariate statistics (Frequency Ratio (FR), Statistical Index (SI)) and machine learning (Naïve Bayes Tree (NBT), Logistic Regression (LR)). To reach such a goal, different physical-geographical factors (criteria) were integrated and mapped. To access the relationship and interdependences among the criteria, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) were used. Based on the experts’ decisions, the DEMATEL-ANP model was used to compute the relative weights of different criteria and a GIS-based linear combination was performed to derive the susceptibility index. Separately, the flood susceptibility index computation through NBT-FR and NBT-SI hybrid models assumed, in the first stage, the estimation of the weight of each class/category of conditioning factor through SI and FR and the integration of these values in NBT algorithm. The application of LR stand-alone required the calculation of the weights of conditioning factors by analysing their spatial relation with the location of the historical flood events. The study revealed that very high and high flood susceptibility classes covered between 20% and 47% of the study area, respectively. The validation of results, using the past flood points, highlighted that the hybrid DEMATEL-ANP model was the most performant with an Area Under ROC curve higher than 0.97, an accuracy of 0.922 and a value of HSS of 0.844. The presented methodological approach used for the identification of flood susceptible areas can serve as an alternative for the updating of preliminary flood risk assessment based on the EU Floods Directive. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the latest years, service selection is becoming more and more important due to the significant effect of internet based services in the telecom industry. When it comes to selecting the best service, different candidate services with similar settings are proposed by different service providers. The selection should take into consideration the respect of the constraints of consumers in terms of Service Level Agreement contracts, what makes the modelling of the preferences of decision-makers for choice problems the main focus of this work. In order to model these preferences, we propose contextual preference functions based on machine learning techniques from neural networks. It will therefore be possible to further explain and decode preferences in order to facilitate negotiation and thus decision-making, thereby improving the quality of service providers while being on customer preferences. © 2020 ACM.},

The model integrates the qualitative and quantitative indicators of the future service and includes the forecasted needs of consumers, based on which one can assess their potential demand and competitiveness by the criterion of price / quality ratio. The proposed model has two distinctive features. Firstly, forecasting customer requirements for the quality of services is based on the results of machine learning on data of existing and potential customers, as well as based on the accumulated knowledge base of consumer experience and expert opinions. Secondly, the model involves multi-criteria optimization, while some of the optimized parameters are discrete or qualitative (verbal, non-digital, non-measureable). In conclusion, the authors demonstrated the advantages of the developed model by the examples of the transport and logistics business in the field of passenger and freight transportation in Russia. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Many scientific papers are devoted to solving multi-criteria problems. Researchers solve these problems, usually using methods that find discrete solutions and with the collaboration of domain experts. In both symmetrical and asymmetrical problems, the challenge is when new decision-making variants emerge. Unfortunately, discreet identification of preferences makes it impossible to determine the preferences for new alternatives. In this work, we propose a new approach to identifying a multi-criteria decision model to address this challenge. Our proposal is based on stochastic optimization techniques and the characteristic objects method (COMET). An extensive work comparing the use of hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization algorithms are presented in this paper. The paper also contains preliminary studies on initial conditions. Finally, our approach has been demonstrated using a simple numerical example. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Coastal areas are expected to be at a higher risk of flooding when climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) is combined with episodic rises in sea level. Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM), mostly based on statistical and machine learning methods, has been widely employed to mitigate flood risk; however, they neglect exposure and vulnerability assessment as the key components of flood risk. Flood risk assessment is often conducted by quantitative methods (e.g., probabilistic). Such assessment uses analytical and empirical techniques to construct the physical vulnerability curves of elements at risk, but the role of people's capacity, depending on social vulnerability, remains limited. To address this gap, this study developed a semiquantitative method, based on the spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). The model combines two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, and factors triggering coastal flooding in Bandar Abbas, Iran. It also employs an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model to weight indicators of hazard, exposure, and social vulnerability components. Under the most extreme flooding scenario, 14.8% of flooded areas were identified as high and very high risk, mostly located in eastern, western, and partly in the middle of the City. The results of this study can be employed by decision-makers to apply appropriate risk reduction strategies in high-risk flooding zones. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={In many forensic psychiatric hospitals, patients’ mental health is monitored at regular intervals. Typically, clinicians score patients using a Likert scale on multiple criteria including hostility. Having an overview of patients’ scores benefits staff members in at least three ways. First, the scores may help adjust treatment to the individual patient; second, the change in scores over time allows an assessment of treatment effectiveness; third, the scores may warn staff that particular patients are at high risk of turning violent, either before or after release. Practical importance notwithstanding, current practices for the analysis of mental health scores are suboptimal: evaluations from different clinicians are averaged (as if the Likert scale were linear and the clinicians identical), and patients are analyzed in isolation (as if they were independent). Uncertainty estimates of the resulting score are often ignored. Here we outline a quantitative program for the analysis of mental health scores using cultural consensus theory (CCT; Anders and Batchelder, 2015). CCT models take into account the ordinal nature of the Likert scale, the individual differences among clinicians, and the possible commonalities between patients. In a simulation, we compare the predictive performance of the CCT model to the current practice of aggregating raw observations and, as an alternative, against often-used machine learning toolboxes. In addition, we outline the substantive conclusions afforded by the application of the CCT model. We end with recommendations for clinical practitioners who wish to apply CCT in their own work. © 2020 The Author(s)},

In this work, a data-driven and machine learning-based predictive modeling framework has been developed for performing combined input and model selection towards generating easily interpretable, parsimonious and accurate regression models intended for gas turbine engine performance analysis. The proposed multistage predictive modeling framework incorporates the orthogonal least squares (OLS) learning and multi-criteria decision-making approach for selecting inputs and model structures in a computationally efficient manner while optimizing multiple objectives. The regression models obtained from this framework for predicting power and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) outputs using GTE operational data collected over a period of three years have demonstrated short-term and long-term performance deterioration patterns for the GTE. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Biosphere Reserves are archetypal parts of natural and cultural landscapes encompassing over large area of different ecosystem, it represents bio-geographic zones of an region. Globally, the areas of biosphere reserve is shrinking and exploiting due to the extreme climatic condition, natural calamities and anthropogenic activities, which leads to environmental and land degradation. In this paper Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBSR) area has been selected and it represents a biodiversity-rich ecosystem in the Western Ghats and includes two of the ten biogeographical provinces of India. Amongst the most insubstantial ecosystems in the world, the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is bearing the substance of climate change evident in increasingly unpredictable rainfall and higher temperatures during recent years. The region was mostly unscathed till two centuries ago, but has witnessed large-scale destruction ever since. In this scenario, a need of application of remote sensing and advance machine learning techniques to monitor environmental degradation and its ecosystem in NBSR is more essential. The objective of the present study is to develop satellite image classification techniques that can reliably to map forest cover and land use, and provide the basis for long-term monitoring. Advanced image classification techniques on the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) for mapping vegetation and land use types, and analyse their spatial distributions. To restore degraded ecosystems to their natural conditions through proper management and conservation practices. In order to understand the nature of environmental degradation and its ecosystem in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve; following thematic criteria's were grouped in to four major indicators such as Terrain Indicator (TI), Environmental Indicator (EI), Hydro-Meteorological Indicator (HMI) and Socio-Economic Indicator (SEI). The utilisation of remote sensing product of huge datasets and various data product in analysis and advanced machine learning algorithm through Google earth engine are indispensable. After extraction of all the thematic layers by using multi criteria decision and fuzzy linear member based weight and ranks were assigned and overlay in GIS environment at a common pixel size of 30 m. Based on the analysis the resultant layer has been classified into five environmental degraded classes i.e., very high, high, moderate, slight and no degradation. This study is help to identify the degradation and long term monitoring and suggest the appropriate conservation, management and policies, it is a time to implement and protect the Nilgiri biosphere reserves without hindering present stage of natural environment in a sustainable manner. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.},

abstract={Data quality assessment of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data can be carried out by comparing them with a reference spatial data (e.g authoritative data). However, in case of a lack of reference data, the spatial accuracy is unknown. The aim of this work is therefore to propose a framework to infer relative spatial accuracy of OSM data by using machine learning methods. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that there is a relationship between extrinsic and intrinsic quality measures. Thus, starting from a multi-criteria data matching, the process seeks to establish a statistical relationship between measures of extrinsic quality of OSM (i.e. obtained by comparison with reference spatial data) and the measures of intrinsic quality of OSM (i.e. OSM features themselves) in order to estimate extrinsic quality on an unevaluated OSM dataset. The approach was applied on OSM buildings. On our dataset, the resulting regression model predicts the values on the extrinsic quality indicators with 30% less variance than an uninformed predictor. © Copyright:},

abstract={The Choquet capacity and integral is an eminent scheme to represent the interaction knowledge among multiple decision criteria and deal with the independent multiple sources preference information. In this paper, we enhance this scheme's decision pattern learning ability by combining it with another powerful machine learning tool, the random forest of decision trees. We first use the capacity fitting method to train the Choquet capacity and integral-based decision trees and then compose them into the capacity random forest (CRF) to better learn and explain the given decision pattern. The CRF algorithms of solving the correlative multiple criteria based ranking and sorting decision problems are both constructed and discussed. Two illustrative examples are given to show the feasibilities of the proposed algorithms. It is shown that on the one hand, CRF method can provide more detailed explanation information and a more reliable collective prediction result than the main existing capacity fitting methods; on the other hand, CRF extends the applicability of the traditional random forest method into solving the multiple criteria ranking and sorting problems with a relatively small pool of decision learning data. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Renewable energy utilisation, latent energy storage, optimal system design, and robust system operation are critical elements for carbon-free buildings and communities. Machine learning methods are effective to assist the energy-efficient renewable systems during multi-criteria design and multi-level uncertainty-based operation periods. However, the current literature provides little knowledge on this topic. In this study, a state-of-the-art-review on phase change materials for cooling applications is presented, in terms of smart ventilations, intelligent PCMs charging/discharging, deterministic parametrical analysis, stochastic uncertainty-based performance prediction and optimisation. Furthermore, technical effectiveness of machine learning methods in single and multi-objective optimisations has been presented, through hybrid PCMs integrated renewable systems. Multivariables involved in the review include thermo-physical, geometrical and operating parameters of PCMs. Multi-criteria employed in the review include heat transfer rate, cooling energy storage density, heat storage and release efficiency, and indoor thermal comfort. The literature review presents technical challenges, such as tradeoff solutions between computational accuracy and efficiency, generic methods for effective selection amongst multi-diversified optimal solutions along the Pareto front, the general methodology for multi-level uncertainty quantification, smart controllers with accurate predictions under high-level parameters’ uncertainty and stochastic occupants’ behaviors. The future outlook and recommendations of machine learning methods in PCMs integrated cooling systems have also been presented as avenues for upcoming research. © 2020},

abstract={Combining neural networks with continuous logic and multicriteria decision-making tools can reduce the black-box nature of neural models. In this study, we show that nilpotent logical systems offer an appropriate mathematical framework for hybridization of continuous nilpotent logic and neural models, helping to improve the interpretability and safety of machine learning. In our concept, perceptrons model soft inequalities; namely membership functions and continuous logical operators. We design the network architecture before training, using continuous logical operators and multicriteria decision tools with given weights working in the hidden layers. Designing the structure appropriately leads to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters to be learned. The theoretical basis offers a straightforward choice of activation functions (the cutting function or its differentiable approximation, the squashing function), and also suggests an explanation to the great success of the rectified linear unit (ReLU). In this study, we focus on the architecture of a hybrid model and introduce the building blocks for future applications in deep neural networks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The commonly used utility model is the weighted summation. The model assumes the independency between criteria and the same attitude towards each performance value of alternatives, which is often unrealistic in practice. To solve this problem, this study presents an ACI-SMAA (Attitudinal Choquet Integral-based Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis) model to consider the criteria interaction and attitudinal parameter of human decision behavior in decision analysis. The ACI-SMAA model is helpful to learn human preferences and analyze latent correlations.

abstract={Illegal tapping of fuel pipelines has recently become one of the most relevant safety problems faced by the industry. Hundreds of illegal interventions have been reported around the world, causing a significant number of deaths, relevant impacts on the environment, and capital loss. Therefore, it is important to develop systems that are able to detect such scenarios at an early stage, enabling a fast counteract. To this end, machine learning algorithms can train models on available data for detecting future issues. Most recently, ensemble learning and dynamic classifier selection (DCS) techniques have been achieving promising results in supervised learning tasks. Such models are usually trained based on a single criterion. However, it is desirable to take into account both the number of false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) for the illegal tapping detection task, since they are conflicting and both lead to financial losses and/or accidents. Therefore, this work proposes a novel DCS technique based on multiple criteria, namely overall local class-specific accuracy (OLCA), which employs multi-criteria decision making for dynamically selecting the best classifier for a new sample given the local true positive and negative ratios. A numerical experiment is conducted for assessing the generalization performance of the proposed method in an oil pipeline, with the goal of detecting illegal taping using pressure transient signals. Results show that OLCA is able to reduce the number of both FP and FN when dynamically selecting the classifiers of a baseline Random Forest ensemble. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Accounting for about 290,000–650,000 deaths across the globe, seasonal influenza is estimated by the World Health Organization to be a major cause of mortality. Hence, there is a need for a reliable and robust epidemiological surveillance decision-making system to understand and combat this epidemic disease. In a previous study, the authors proposed a decision support system to fight against seasonal influenza. This system is composed of three subsystems: (i) modeling and simulation, (ii) data warehousing, and (iii) analysis. The analysis subsystem relies on spatial online analytical processing (S-OLAP) technology. Although the S-OLAP technology is useful in analyzing multidimensional spatial data sets, it cannot take into account the inherent multicriteria nature of seasonal influenza risk assessment by itself. Therefore, the objective of this article is to extend the existing decision support system by adding advanced multicriteria analysis capabilities for enhanced seasonal influenza risk assessment and monitoring. Bearing in mind the characteristics of the decision problem considered in this article, a well-known multicriteria classification method, the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA), was selected to boost the existing decision support system. Combining the S-OLAP technology and the multicriteria classification method DRSA in the same decision support system will largely improve and extend the scope of analysis capabilities. The extended decision support system has been validated by its application to assess seasonal influenza risk in the northwest region of Algeria. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis},

abstract={Wind energy installation numbers have witnessed a sharp increase in the recent past. Additionally, wind farms are seen as an effective and potent part of the interconnected power system. Significant variations in the wind speed pose a challenge for wind farm operators to provide accurate forecasts. In this manuscript, three hybrid wind farms, each comprising of wind turbines and battery energy storage systems, are located in the vicinity of each other and are assumed to deliver power to a utility grid. Fuzzy-based Multi-criteria decision-making techniques are applied to this cluster of three hybrid wind farms to determine the best strategy. Machine learning-based LSSVR method is utilized for wind speed forecasting and penalty cost estimation. Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy COPRAS evaluated and potential reversal of rankings is also explored. With a cumulative priority score of 0.4573 and 99.3 for dataset X1, both, fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy COPRAS respectively indicate that A3, that is, paying penalty for power borrowed from a neighboring wind farm is the best alternative for a hybrid wind farm. This study gives new insights into decision-making, specifically for hybrid wind farms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Construction engineering and management are vital for successful project execution, and both researchers and practitioners continually seek ways to improve construction processes. Fuzzy logic plays an important role in many construction engineering and management applications, which are reviewed in this paper. This paper discusses the limitations of fuzzy logic and how this theory has been combined with other modeling techniques to develop fuzzy hybrid techniques, and describes the aspects of construction problems and decision making that are most effectively modeled using these techniques. Fuzzy hybrid techniques that are most common in construction are presented and examples from construction literature and the author's research program are provided. The author shares her vision of future research in this area, which is based on her expertise and experiences collaborating with construction industry partners, who have helped shape her research program and its impact on industry. Finally, the author presents her thoughts on the challenges construction researchers face in translating research to practice and measuring its impact, and she discusses some potential solutions from her research program.

abstract={The loading of the ship is investigated under fully loaded and ballast conditions. Each case is categorized numerically under 1 and 0 for fully loaded and ballast conditions, respectively. The multi criteria decision making (MCDM) method is applied to advance and support the decision-making system for ship operations and ship owners. The parameters analysed in this research include wind speed, wave height, ship speed, distance travelled, and shaft speed. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (Fuzzy-AHP) method has been used to prioritise the weight of criteria decision making. They will provide a fundamental criterion to support the commercial stakeholders, loading & navigation of the vessels. The novelty methodology indicates that machine learning could be used in decision making for optimal loading of the ship. The optimal loading of the ship and fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine has been achieved from this research by the proposed methodology.

abstract={This paper is motivated by decommissioning studies in the field of oil and gas, which comprise a very large number of installations and are of interest to a large number of stakeholders. Generally, the problem gives rise to complicated multi-criteria decision aid tools that rely upon the costly evaluation of multiple criteria for every piece of equipment. We propose the use of machine learning techniques to reduce the number of criteria by feature selection, thereby reducing the number of required evaluations and producing a simplified decision aid tool with no sacrifice in performance. In addition, we also propose the use of machine learning to explore the patterns of the multi-criteria decision aid tool in a training set. Hence, we predict the outcome of the analysis for the remaining pieces of equipment, effectively replacing the multi-criteria analysis by the computational intelligence acquired from running it in the training set. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Software quality estimation is an activity needed at various stages of software development. It may be used for planning the project's quality assurance practices and for benchmarking. In earlier previous studies, two methods (Multiple Criteria Linear Programming and Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming) for estimating the quality of software had been used Also, C5.0, SVM and Neutral network were experimented with for quality estimation. These studies have relatively low accuracies. In this study, we aimed to improve estimation accuracy by using relevant features of a large dataset. We used a feature selection method and correlation matrix for reaching higher accuracies. In addition, we have experimented with recent methods shown to be successful for other prediction tasks. Machine learning algorithms such as Xgboost, Random Forest and Decision Tree are applied to the data to predict the software quality and reveal the relation between the quality and development attributes. The experimental results show that the quality level of software can be well estimated by machine learning algorithms. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Exposure to indoor radon at home and in workplaces constitutes a serious public health risk and is the second most prevalent cause of lung cancer after tobacco smoking. Indoor radon concentration is to a large extent controlled by so-called geogenic radon, which is radon generated in the ground. While indoor radon has been mapped in many parts of Europe, this is not the case for its geogenic control, which has been surveyed exhaustively in only a few countries or regions. Since geogenic radon is an important predictor of indoor radon, knowing the local potential of geogenic radon can assist radon mitigation policy in allocating resources and tuning regulations to focus on where it needs to be prioritized. The contribution of geogenic to indoor radon can be quantified in different ways: the geogenic radon potential (GRP) and the geogenic radon hazard index (GRHI). Both are constructed from geogenic quantities, with their differences tending to be, but not always, their type of geographical support and optimality as indoor radon predictors. An important feature of the GRHI is consistency across borders between regions with different data availability and Rn survey policies, which has so far impeded the creation of a European map of geogenic radon. The GRHI can be understood as a generalization or extension of the GRP. In this paper, the concepts of GRP and GRHI are discussed and a review of previous GRHI approaches is presented, including methods of GRHI estimation and some preliminary results. A methodology to create GRHI maps that cover most of Europe appears at hand and appropriate; however, further fine tuning and validation remains on the agenda. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The figure of merit is of crucial importance in materials design to search for candidates with optimal functionality. In the field of photovoltaics, the bandgap (Eg) is a well-recognized figure of merit for screening solar cell absorbers subject to the Shockley-Queisser limit. In this paper, the bandgap as the figure of merit is challenged since an ideal solar cell absorber requires multiple criteria such as stability, optical absorption, and carrier lifetime. Multiple criteria make the quantitative description of material candidates difficult and computationally time-consuming. Taking halide perovskites as an example, we combine thermodynamic stability (ΔHd) and Eg into a unified figure of merit and use Bayesian optimization (BO) to accelerate materials screening. We have found that, in comparison to an exhaustive search via multiple parameters, BO based on the unified figure of merit can screen optimal candidates (Eg,PBE between 0.6–1.2 eV, ΔHd&gt;–29 meV per atom) more efficiently. Therefore, the proposed method opens a viable route for the search of optimal solar cell absorbers from a large amount of material candidates with less computational cost. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={High-fidelity multi-scale design optimization of many real-life applications in structural engineering still remains largely intractable due to the computationally intensive nature of numerical solvers like finite element method. Thus, in this paper, an alternate route of metamodel-based design optimization methodology is proposed in multi-scale framework based on a symbolic regression implemented using genetic programming (GP) coupled with d-optimal design. This approach drastically cuts the computational costs by replacing the finite element module with appropriately constructed robust and efficient metamodels. Resulting models are compact, have good interpretability and assume a free-form expression capable of capturing the non-linearly, complexity and vastness of the design space. Two robust nature-inspired optimization algorithms, viz. multi-objective genetic algorithm and multi-objective particle swarm optimization, are used to generate Pareto optimal solutions for several test problems with varying complexity. TOPSIS, a multi-criteria decision-making approach, is then applied to choose the best alternative among the Pareto optimal sets. Finally, the applicability of GP in efficiently tackling multi-scale optimization problems of composites is investigated, where a real-life scenario is explored by varying fractions of pertinent engineering materials to bring about property changes in the final composite structure across two different scales. The study reveals that a microscale optimization leads to better optimized solutions, demonstrating the advantage of carrying out a multi-scale optimization without any additional computational burden. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The transition of the energy system from fossil fuel towards renewable energy (RE) is rising sharply, which provides a cleaner energy source to the urban smart grid system. However, owing to the volatility and intermittency of RE, it is challenging to design an accurate and reliable short-term load forecasting model. Recently, machine learning (ML) based forecasting models have been applied for short-term load forecasting whereas most of them ignore the importance of characteristics mining, parameters fine-tuning, and forecasting stability. To dissolve the above issues, a short-term load forecasting model is proposed that incorporates thorough data mining and multi-step rolling forecasting. To alleviate the chaos of short-term load, a de-noising method based on decomposition and reconstruction is used. Then, a phase space reconstruction (PSR) method is employed to dynamically determine the train-test ratios and neurons settings of the artificial neural network (ANN). Further, a multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm (MOGOA) is applied to optimize the parameters of ANNs. Case studies are conducted in the urban smart grid systems of Victoria and New South Wales in Australia. Simulation results show that the proposed model can forecast short-term load well with various measurement metrics. Multiple criterion and statistical evaluation also show the good performance of the proposed forecasting model in terms of accuracy and stability. To conclude, the proposed model achieves high accuracy and robustness, which will provide references to RE transitions and smart grid optimization, and offer guidance to sustainable city development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Recommender systems (RSs) are personalization tools that gives recommendations for items to users by exploiting various methods. Conventional collaborative filtering (CF) based RSs provide suggestions to users based on overall rating of items which is not an efficient procedure as users in system may have different choices on different criteria. So, multicriteria recommender systems (MCRS) came into existence as an extension of traditional CF based RSs. MCRS recommends items to users based on number of criteria. Recommending products to users from the vast catalog is still a challenge for researchers. This paper presents a review of some significant work in the area of multi-criteria recommender system. After a brief introduction, we present review of existing methods categories according to heuristic and model based approach, and some of the popular approaches are classified into different sets such as recommendation fields, research problem, data mining and machine learning techniques. Insights and possible future work in the area of MCRSs are also discussed. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Climate-adaptive design, smart control, latent thermal storages, multi-dimensional uncertainty analysis, and multi-objective optimisations are effective solutions for cooling performance enhancement of buildings through integrated techniques, such as hybrid ventilations, nocturnal sky radiation, radiative cooling and active PV cooling for the self-consumption. However, there is no systematic and in-depth analysis on this topic in the academia. In this study, a state-of-the-art review on novel PCMs based strategies to reduce cooling load of buildings has been presented. The investigated strategies include the structural configuration, systematic control and the multi-criteria for assessment. The roles of ventilations, radiative cooling and the underlying heat transfer mechanism have been characterized for the in-depth understanding. In order to realise the multivariable optimal design and robust operations under multi-level scenario uncertainties, parametric and uncertainty analysis, single- and multi-objective optimisations have been comprehensively reviewed, together with technical challenges for each solution. Research results show that, integrated passive and active systems with flexible transitions on operating modes are full of prospects for the multi-criteria performance improvement. Trade-off solutions along the multi-objective Pareto frontier are multi-diversified, dependent on the adopted approach and the studied scenario. Furthermore, machine learning methods are promising for the thermal and energy performances improvement, through the surrogate model development, the model predictive control and the optimisation function. Future studies and prospects have been demonstrated as avenues for future research.

abstract={Planetary gear train is a prominent component of helicopter transmission system and its health is of great significance for the flight safety of the helicopter. During health condition monitoring, the selection of a fault sensitive feature subset is meaningful for fault diagnosis of helicopter planetary gear train. According to actual situation, this paper proposed a multi-criteria fusion feature selection algorithm (MCFFSA) to identify an optimal feature subset from the high-dimensional original feature space. In MCFFSA, a fault feature set of multiple domains, including time domain, frequency domain and wavelet domain, is first extracted from the raw vibration dataset. Four targeted criteria are then fused by multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to find Proto-efficient subsets, wherein two criteria for measuring diagnostic performance are assessed by sparse Bayesian extreme learning machine (SBELM). Further, F-measure is adopted to identify the optimal feature subset, which was employed for subsequent fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of MCFFSA is validated through six fault recognition datasets from a real helicopter transmission platform. The experimental results illustrate the superiority of combination of MOEA/D and SBELM in MCFFSA, and comparative analysis demonstrates that the optimal feature subset provided by MCFFSA can achieve a better diagnosis performance than other algorithms. © 2019 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics},

abstract={Application of super-insulating materials in building glazing system shows promising prospects for low-energy buildings. In this research, the heat transfer, solar radiation transmission and indoor illuminance of an aerogel glazing system were characterized through an experimentally validated numerical model. Contribution ratios of multi-variables to multi-objectives were thereafter quantified, following the Taguchi standard orthogonal array. In respect to the application of aerogel glazing system in subtropical climates, an energy-related contradiction between indoor illuminance from solar and indoor heat gain, has been presented, discussed, together with effective solutions. In order to minimise the total heat gain and maximise the indoor illuminance transmitted through the aerogel glazing system, a generic multi-objective optimisation methodology, with high computational efficiency and accuracy, has been developed, to identify the optimal design. The results indicate that through the Pareto front from the multi-objective optimisation results, a significant reduction of total heat gain and an obvious increase of the indoor illuminance can be noticed. Compared to the optimal case in the standard orthogonal array, with the application of the proposed multi-objective optimisation methodology, the annual total heat gain could be reduced from 489305.5 to 333396.4 Wh by 31.9% and the annual indoor illuminance could be increased from 56786.6 to 172973.5 lux by 67.2%. The year-round performance indicates that, compared to the bi-objective optimisation (annual transmitted heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) with the annual total heat gain at 333.4 kWh/m2 and annual indoor illuminance at 162.3 klux, the bi-objective optimisation (annual total heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) shows a lower annual total heat gain at 322.4 kWh/m2 by 3.4%) and a higher annual indoor illuminance at 173 klux by 6.6%. This study proposes an overall framework and technical guidance of a new multi-objective optimisation methodology, which can automatically learn mechanisms of heat transfer and solar radiation transmittance through nanoporous aerogel granules, and identify the optimal multi-variables setting for the robust system design and operation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Bank failure prediction models usually combine financial attributes through binary classification approaches. In this study we extend this standard framework in three main directions. First, we explore the predictive power of attributes that describe the diversification of banking operations. Second, we consider the prediction of failure in a multi-period context. Finally, an enhanced ordinal classification framework is introduced, which considers multiple instances of failed banks prior to failure (up to three years prior to bankruptcy). Various ordinal models are developed using techniques from multiple criteria decision analysis, statistics, and machine learning. Moreover, ensemble models based on error-correcting output codes are examined. The analysis is based on a sample consisting of approximately 60,000 observations for banks in the United States over the period 2006–2015. The results show that diversification attributes improve the predictive power of bank failure prediction models, mainly for mid to long-term prediction horizons. Moreover, ordinal classification models provide a better description of the state of the banks prior to failure and are competitive to standard binary classification models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Taking into account the exponential growth of the number of flash-floods events worldwide, the detection of areas prone to these natural hazards is one of the main activities taken in order to mitigate the negative effects of these risk phenomena. In the present paper, new modeling approaches, Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) integrated with IOE (ADT-IOE) and ADT integrated with AHP (ADT-AHP), were proposed for flash-flood susceptibility mapping across the Suha river catchment (Romania). Besides, two stand-alone methods, Index of Entropy (IOE) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were also investigated. For this regard, 111 torrential points and 111 non-torrential points along with 8 flash-flood conditioning factors have been involved in the training process of the four models. The quality of the flash-flood models was checked by using the ROC Curve method, classification accuracy (CLA), and Kappa index. The result shows that the two ensemble models, the ADT-IOE (AUC = 0.972, CLC = 86.37%, Kappa statistics = 0.727) and the ADT-AHP (AUC = 0.926, CLA = 87.88%, Kappa statistics = 0.758), have high prediction performance and outperform the other models. Therefore, ADT-IOE and ADT-AHP are new and promising tools for flash-flood susceptibility modeling. © 2018},

abstract={Sensory evaluation plays an important role in the food and consumer goods industry. In recent years, the application of machine learning techniques to support food sensory evaluation has become popular. Many different machine learning methods have been applied and produced positive results in this field. In this article, the authors propose a new method to support sensory evaluation on multiple criteria based on the use of a correlation-based feature selection technique, combined with machine learning methods such as linear regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, and random forest.

abstract={Understanding what Machine Learning models are doing is not always trivial. This is especially true for complex models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are the best-suited algorithms for modeling very complex and nonlinear relationships. But this need to understand has become a must since privacy regulations are hardening the industrial use of these models. There are different techniques to address the interpretability issues that Machine Learning models arises. This paper is focused on opening the so-called Deep Neural architectures black-box. This research extends the technique called Layer-wise Relevant Propagation (LRP) enhancing its properties to compute the most critical paths in different deep neural architectures using multicriteria analysis. We call this technique Ranked-LRP and it was tested on four different datasets and tasks, including classification and regression. The results show the worth of our proposal. © 2019},

abstract={Condorcet consistent rules were originally developed for preference aggregation in the theory of social choice. Nowadays these rules are applied in a variety of fields such as discrete multi-criteria analysis, defence and security decision support, composite indicators, machine learning, artificial intelligence, queries in databases or internet multiple search engines and theoretical computer science. The cycle issue, known also as Condorcet's paradox, is the most serious problem inherent in this type of rules. Solutions for dealing with the cycle issue properly already exist in the literature; the most important one being the identification of the median ranking, often called the Kemeny ranking. Unfortunately its identification is a NP-hard problem. This article has three main objectives: (1) to clarify that the Kemeny median order has to be framed in the context of Condorcet consistent rules; this is important since in the current practice sometimes even the Borda count is used as a proxy for the Kemeny ranking. (2) To present a new exact algorithm, this identifies the Kemeny median ranking by providing a searching time guarantee. (3) To present a new heuristic algorithm identifying the Kemeny median ranking with an optimal trade-off between convergence and approximation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

The aim is to allow the quantification of the quality of cross-border road connections and the identification of areas where infrastructure improvements can lead to higher benefits. We propose a machine learning approach that combines cell level route assignment and k-means clustering at a fine −1 square km- population grid.

abstract={The analysis and improvement of product quality for process industry is an increasing concern for academia and industry. As the outputs of a manufacturing system mainly depend on corresponding input conditions, so it is of high significance to develop an optimization scheme to actively and accurately determine operating parameters to obtain desired quality. However, the widely employed single-model modeling mode for whole production process neglects the natural characteristics within process manufacturing system such as multistage manufacturing and hysteresis. Additionally, the popular data-driven modeling techniques in current works, especially black-box machine learning models have been restricted to satisfying the requirements regarding excellent approximation capability and explicit mathematical expression simultaneously. To fill up above research gap, it is meaningful to develop a new data-driven optimization scheme in this work to effectively and accurately determine the optimum operating parameters considering the abovementioned characteristics and requirements. Firstly, two different connecting strategies are discussed to determine the more accurate and feasible quality propagation mode between adjacent stages. Then, two computational intelligence (CI) techniques, i.e., Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP) and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm are exploited to construct correlation model with explicit mathematical expression and derive the optimal operating parameters, respectively. Afterwards, the fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) method is further proposed to select the optimal solution from the obtained Pareto solutions sets. The application of the proposed scheme in a coal preparation process indicates that the proposed scheme is promising and competitive on prediction accuracy and optimization efficiency over baseline methods, and can significantly improve the final product quality comparing with initial parameters setting. Moreover, the feasible quality specification for intermediate product can also be obtained by our proposed scheme which is beneficial for early detection of quality abnormality and timely parameters adjustment. © 2020},

abstract={The present study developed a feature selection (FS)-based decision support system using the electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from neonates with and without seizures. The study employed 10 different FS algorithms to reduce the classification cost by using fewer features and to improve the classification performance of the model by removing the irrelevant features. In doing so, the classification performance of each FS algorithm on each EEG channel difference was also evaluated. The dataset used in the study included EEG measurements and visual EEG annotations that were recorded from 79 term neonates. Multiple features were extracted from each channel difference using the Feature extraction (FE). Subsequently, a novel feature subset was generated for the classification using FS algorithms. The classification performance of each selected feature was assessed based on multiple criteria. The use of features extracted by the combined use of FS algorithms showed higher performance compared to the use of all features. In this study, 18 channel differences were analyzed. Better performance was achieved by using 3 of the selected 14 features or 2 of the selected features. The C4-P4 channel difference showed the highest classification performance (98.8%) among all channel differences. In the literature, FE has already been performed for the classification of the dataset used in the present study. The primary aim of the present study was to perform the same classification with the minimum number of features. The results indicated that feature reduction reduced the cost and also improved the performance of the classification. These results seem to be highly promising and thus can be used in clinical practice and shed light for future studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Risk management is a vital factor for ensuring better quality software development processes. Moreover, risks are the events that could adversely affect the organization activities or the development of projects. Effective prioritization of software project risks play a significant role in determining whether the project will be successful in terms of performance characteristics or not. In this work, we develop a new hybrid fuzzy-based machine learning mechanism for performing risk assessment in software projects. This newly developed hybridized risk assessment scheme can be used to determine and rank the significant software project risks that support the decision making during the software project lifecycle. For better assessment of the software project risks, we have incorporated fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based multi-criteria decision making (ANFIS MCDM) and intuitionistic fuzzy-based TODIM (IF-TODIM) approaches. More significantly, for the newly introduced ANFIS MCDM approach, the parameters of ANFIS are adjusted using a traditional crow search algorithm (CSA) which applies only a reasonable as well as small changes in variables. The main activity of CSA in ANFIS is to find the best parameter to achieve most accurate software risk estimate. Experimental validation was conducted on NASA 93 dataset having 93 software project values. The result of this method exhibits a vivid picture that provides software risk factors that are key determinant for achievement of the project performance. Experimental outcomes reveal that our proposed integrated fuzzy approaches can exhibit better and accurate performance in the assessment of software project risks compared to other existing approaches. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Gully erosion is a problem; therefore, it must be predicted using highly accurate predictive models to avoid losses caused by gully development and to guarantee sustainable development. This research investigates the predictive performance of seven multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM), statistical, and machine learning (ML)-based models and their ensembles for gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM). A case study of the Dasjard River watershed, Iran uses a database of 306 gully head cuts and 15 conditioning factors. The database was divided 70:30 to train and verify the models. Their performance was assessed with the area under prediction rate curve (AUPRC), the area under success rate curve (AUSRC), accuracy, and kappa. Results show that slope is key to gully formation. The maximum entropy (ME) ML model has the best performance (AUSRC = 0.947, AUPRC = 0.948, accuracy = 0.849 and kappa = 0.699). The second best is the random forest (RF) model (AUSRC = 0.965, AUPRC = 0.932, accuracy = 0.812 and kappa = 0.624). By contrast, the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) model was the least effective (AUSRC = 0.871, AUPRC = 0.867, accuracy = 0.758 and kappa = 0.516). RF increased the performance of statistical index (SI) and frequency ratio (FR) statistical models. Furthermore, the combination of a generalized linear model (GLM), and functional data analysis (FDA) improved their performances. The results demonstrate that a combination of geographic information systems (GIS) with remote sensing (RS)-based ML models can successfully map gully erosion susceptibility, particularly in low-income and developing regions. This method can aid the analyses and decisions of natural resources managers and local planners to reduce damages by focusing attention and resources on areas prone to the worst and most damaging gully erosion. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={This paper is a case study of utilizing machine learning for developing a decision-making system for auditors before initializing the audit fieldwork of public firms. Annual data of 777 firms from 14 different sectors are collected and a MCTOPE (Multi criteria ToPsis based Ensemble) framework is implemented to build an ensemble classifier. MCTOPE framework optimizes the performance of classification during ensemble building using the TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making algorithm. Ensemble machine learning is used for optimizing the prediction performance of suspicious firm predictor in the previous work available at https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08839514.2018.1451032. After achieving an accuracy of 94.6% and AUC (area under the curve) value of 0.98, this ensemble classifier is employed in a web application developed for auditors using Python and R script for the prediction of suspicious firm before planning an external audit. The performance of an ensemble classifier is validated using K-fold cross validation technique and is found to be better than the state-of-the-art classifiers. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.},

funding_text 2={In this paper, a case study of an external audit company is studied and an ensemble classifier-based web application is built to help in the decision-making process of predicting the suspicious firm before an external audit. Different from the traditional approach of classification, a MCTOPE framework builds an efficient ensemble classifier by optimizing the overall performance of the classifier using TOPSIS algorithm, a multi-criteria decision-making technique. After more than 1000 iterations, the performance of the final ensemble using Naive Bayes and Decision Tree as base classifiers with the highest TOPSIS performance score is depicted on each fold of the 10-fold cross validation method. The classifier is found to be robust with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F measure, MCC, AUC of 94, 1, 0.92, 0.94, 0.83, and 0.98, respectively. When compared with the state-of-the-art classifiers, it is found to be better than the available methods, serving as a proof of eligibility of classifiers to perform an efficient fraudulent firm prediction in the audit fieldwork decision-making process. For future works, we are targeting to offer the auditors to handle the last 10-year data of firms on the top of advance big data techniques like Hadoop, Spark, etc. This research work is supported by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY), Govt. of India (Grant No. DoRSP/1633).

abstract={Industrial processes must be well equipped with a variety of sensors to maintain a desired quality. However, some variables cannot be easily measured due to different causes, such as acquisition and/or maintenance costs and slow acquisition time. This situation leads to a lack of real-time information in the process, which could lead to lower quality in the final product. One of such processes is the debutanizer column, where butane content measurement is highly delayed. To enable online prediction of such variables, available information from the process can be used to estimate predictive models, known as soft sensors. To this end, data-driven techniques can be used, such as statistical and machine learning. However, such techniques usually take into account a single metric when estimating the models, and there are multiple factors that play an important role when designing a soft sensor, such as stability and accuracy. To cope with such a situation, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization design procedure, where feature selection and ensemble member combination are performed. Therefore, the multi-objective differential evolution algorithm with spherical pruning (spMODE-II) is initially employed for building a pool of non-dominated linear support vector regression (SVR) models. Subsequently, the same evolutionary algorithm is applied for selecting the weights of the previously generated models in a weighted combination ensemble. In a final multi-criteria decision making stage, a preferred ensemble is selected using the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE). Results indicate that the proposed approach is able to produce a highly stable and accurate butane content soft sensor for the debutanizer column. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Sustainable development of megacities requires a transition to the new management methods and technologies, based on the wide use of a large amount of heterogeneous data. Managing the urban economy needs to consider environmental restrictions, environmental monitoring tasks, engineering facilities, and transport. Operational control over the urban environment and the surrounding area can be produced using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the collected data can be processed using a wide range of software and hardware technologies related to the field of artificial intelligence. However, along with any fairly new technology, intelligent unmanned technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. Strengths are mobility and efficiency, relative cheapness, the possibility of a high degree of automation, whereas weaknesses are short flight time, dependence on weather conditions, the certain outstanding tasks of data management and processing. This paper considers the possibilities of using intelligent unmanned technologies based on UAVs for solving the problems of monitoring the urban environment of the Kazakhstan megalopolises. Consideration is also being given to the scope for extending possibilities of applying these technologies to the field of environmental monitoring, monitoring of hazardous geological processes, technical constructions and vehicles. Furthermore, technological and economic issues, as well as necessary data processing technologies, are discussed. The economic effect of the use of IUVAT is estimated at $ 70-200 million, but it requires solving a set of data processing, control and technical problems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Erosion is a natural phenomenon that happens in all ecosystems, whether due to weather conditions or inappropriate land use. Mapping the erosion vulnerability levels of an area can occur using different methods of geographic inference. However, defining the appropriate method is still a question to be answered. This paper presents an erosion vulnerability map validation approach elaborated by different inference methods. As a case study, a watershed was adopted and the following criteria were considered: geomorphology, pedology, slope, drainage density and land cover. Among the tested methods are: Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and three Fuzzy operators: algebraic sum, algebraic product and gamma, varying the exponent “γ” between the values 0.4; 0.6 and 0.8. The weights of the criteria were defined based on the Hierarchical Analytical Process. The validation of the maps took place using 1902 points, with 951 erosion points in the area defined based on Google Earth Pro images and 951 points without erosion randomly generated in QGIS 3.8. The logistic regression model was used to compare the performance of each map by pointing out the areas with the highest and lowest degree of vulnerability. The best modeling was achieved with the Fuzzy gamma operator when parameterized with γ = 0.6. Although WLC is the recurring approach in environmental studies involving geographic inference, our results show that other operators can produce results closer to those encountered with the reality observed in the field.

abstract={One thing that tourists need to plan their tourism activities is a recommendation system. The tourism destinations recommendation system in this study has three primary nodes, namely user, server, and sensor. Each node requires the ability to share data to produce recommendations that the user expects through their mobile devices. In this paper, we propose the data-sharing system scheme uses a blockchain-based decentralized network that each node can be connected directly to each other, to support the exchange of data between them. The block architecture used in the blockchain network has three main parts, namely block information, hashes, and data. Each type of node has a different structure and direction of data communication. Where the user node sends destination assessment data to the server node, then the server node sends data from the machine learning process to the user node. The sensor sends dynamic data about popularity, traffic, and weather to the user node as consideration for finalizing the generating recommendations process. In the process of sending data, each node in the blockchain network goes through several functions, including hashing, block validation, chaining block, and broadcast. We conduct web-based experiments and analysis of the data-sharing system to illustrate the system works. The experimental results show that the system handles data circulation with an average time of mine is 84.5 ms in sending multi-criteria assessment data from the user and 119.1 ms in sending data of machine learning result from the server. © 20 20},

abstract={In Machine Learning scenarios, privacy is a crucial concern when models have to be trained with private data coming from users of a service, such as a recommender system, a location-based mobile service, a mobile phone text messaging service providing next word prediction, or a face image classification system. The main issue is that, often, data are collected, transferred, and processed by third parties. These transactions violate new regulations, such as GDPR. Furthermore, users usually are not willing to share private data such as their visited locations, the text messages they wrote, or the photo they took with a third party. On the other hand, users appreciate services that work based on their behaviors and preferences. In order to address these issues, Federated Learning (FL) has been recently proposed as a means to build ML models based on private datasets distributed over a large number of clients, while preventing data leakage. A federation of users is asked to train a same global model on their private data, while a central coordinating server receives locally computed updates by clients and aggregate them to obtain a better global model, without the need to use clients' actual data. In this work, we extend the FL approach by pushing forward the state-of-the-art approaches in the aggregation step of FL, which we deem crucial for building a high-quality global model. Specifically, we propose an approach that takes into account a suite of client-specific criteria that constitute the basis for assigning a score to each client based on a priority of criteria defined by the service provider. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets indicate the merits of the proposed approach compared to standard FL baseline. © 2020-IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The impact of contractor selection on construction project success has led to numerous studies on contractor selection. However, an up-to-date systematic review of contractor selection trend is still lacking. This study aims to fill the gap by reviewing published literature from 1990 to 2019. A desktop search was conducted under the ‘T/A/K (title/abstract/keyword)’ in Scopus search engine where 252 papers were identified. Based on a two-phase filtering approach, which included journal relevance assessment and article relevance assessment, 137 published papers within 22 journals were used for the study. The major finding was that the questions were raised on the suitability of selection criteria for appraising contractors and it was acknowledged that, choosing appropriate contractor selection criteria are affected by other factors hence can be regarded as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making problem suitable for machine learning tools. A major limitation of was that, even with the 137 reviewed papers, not all contractor selection-related papers were reviewed. The outcome of the study suggests a greater involvement of practitioners in model development and stimulates future studies that delve into the development of models to aid in selecting optimal contractor selection criteria for a particular project. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The concept of edge computing brings a new paradigm to monitor and manage network traffic at the network's edge. Network traffic classification is a critical task to monitor and identify Internet traffic. Recent traffic classification works suggested using statistical flow features to classify network traffic accurately using machine learning techniques. The selected classification features must be stable and can work across different spatial and temporal heterogeneity. This paper proposes a feature selection mechanism called Ensemble Weight Approach (EWA) for selecting significant features for Internet traffic classification based on multi-criterion ranking and selection mechanisms. Extensive simulations have been conducted using publicly-available traces from the University of Cambridge. The simulation results demonstrate that EWA is capable of identifying stable features subset for Internet traffic identification. EWA-selected features improve the mean accuracy up to 1.3% and reduce RMSE using fewer features than other feature selection methods. The smaller number of features directly contributes to shorter classification time. Furthermore, the selected features can train stable traffic classification generative models irrespective of the dataset's spatial and temporal differences, with consistent accuracy up to 97%. The overall performance indicates that EWA-selected statistical flow features can improve the overall traffic classification. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) aims at modelling expert preferences and assisting decision makers in identifying options best accommodating expert criteria. An instance of MCDM model, the Choquet integral is widely used in real-world applications, due to its ability to capture interactions between criteria while retaining interpretability. Aimed at a better scalability and modularity, hierarchical Choquet integrals involve intermediate aggregations of the interacting criteria, at the cost of a more complex elicitation. The paper presents a machine learning-based approach for the automatic identification of hierarchical MCDM models, composed of 2-additive Choquet integral aggregators and of marginal utility functions on the raw features from data reflecting expert preferences. The proposed NEUR-HCI framework relies on a specific neural architecture, enforcing by design the Choquet model constraints and supporting its end-to-end training. The empirical validation of NEUR-HCI on real-world and artificial benchmarks demonstrates the merits of the approach compared to state-of-art baselines. © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ.

abstract={Smart grids, IoT and big data are the drivers of change in the energy sector. The presented research builds on these concepts by establishing a cooperative model that supports autonomous, self-sustainable and self-organised energy communities. It is based on a multi-agent and multi-criteria negotiation protocol in which consumers are involved on one side, while suppliers take part on the other side. The model maximises utility functions and gains of both sides according to the changing real-time demand and supply of electricity. The negotiation support system aims to automate, aid and structure the decision-making process in the energy sector by the means of monotonic concession protocol and autonomous agents. In addition, machine learning is applied to find patterns in big data pertaining to energy consumption, while blockchain is introduced to reliably store distributed data and to manage contractual relationships between actors in the market. The system hence consists of several interconnected modules that deal with data, knowledge, intelligence, decision-making, negotiation and communication. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Policy makers and energy operator have the responsibility to select indicators for their mission to lead the renewable energy transition ensuring energy independence and security of supply in the context of decarbonisation of the energy mix and and/or nuclear phase-out with increasing cost for flexibility. Engineers are therefore asked to propose key performance indicators (KPI) allowing to quantify the positive impact of operation strategies and efficient technology solutions to harvest and distribute more renewable resources, while minimizing the environmental impact and overall costs. The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of KPIs and their different definitions on planning building energy systems (BES) in order to support decision maker to define, monitor and fulfill their objective. A wide-range of alternative solutions are generated using Mixed Linear Integer Programming (MILP) and Multi Objective Optimization (MOO) to capture the decision space of BES. Machine learning techniques, like principle component analysis and k-medoids clustering, are applied to identify the major trends, thus supporting multi - criteria decision making. Results highlight the correlations between twenty-six indicators, showing the importance of (i) setting appropriate system boundaries, (ii) using hourly resolution and (iii) constructional footprint to characterize flexible systems. Low emission electrical grid mix has a high impact on strategic planning and is in conflict with decentralized, self-sufficient energy systems. Including life cycle assessment (LCA) of the system shows besides operational emission, the constructional footprint is significantly contributing to the total Global Warming Potential (GWP). Considering the ecological optimal BES in Switzerland, this contribution is more than 40%, while for high emission electrical grid mix the latter accounts for more than 90%. © ECOS 2020.All right reserved.},

abstract={West Java is in the five line on the list of provinces in Indonesia with the most COVID-19 cases, as Bandung Metropolitan Area (BMA) is the second most densely populated showing the highest number after Jakarta Greater Area. Bandung Metropolitan Area consist of Bandung City, Cimahi City, Bandung Regency, and West Bandung Regency. Then, an intense movement of people created between the connected city and regency. Bandung City became the epicenter of movement BMA, since it is the province capital city, business, and education center. This fact, putting BMA at the highest risk not only for the pandemic but also socioeconomic issues. The spatial time series risk forecasting information is an essential for the decision-maker to develop a day by day policy aimed for combating the COVID-19 pandemic issue. In this study, the pandemic risk is calculated by combining vulnerability, hazard, and geodemography information. Infimap provides the People in Pixels geodemographic data, added not only the exposure of population distribution to COVID-19 but also the ratio of age. Beside those data, the daily distribution of COVID-19 cases, network data, business point, health facility point, residentials area, geodemographic (People in Pixels), and daily COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports is also been used in this study. The daily vulnerability and hazard data created since the first case on March 4th until August 21st. The hazard area is create based on the expected travel area of positive COVID-19 patient. While the vulnerability area is create using Spatial Multi Criteria Analysis (SMCA) of following data: service area of hospital, groceries (local market), and workspace. Further, the time series data of hazard and vulnerability area was inputted to develop the forecasting model based on the machine learning pipeline of Gaussian algorithm. As a result, this study shows the possibility to predict the future risk area of COVID-19 until the next 100 days condition, based on spatial timeseries forecasting model. © 2020 SPIE},

Security of components is a significant constituent of the system to maintain the existence of the component as well as the system to function smoothly. Component security can protect a component from illegal access and changing its contents. Considering the developments in information security, protecting the components becomes a fundamental issue. In order to tackle such issues, a comprehensive study report is needed which can help practitioners to protect their system.

abstract={This article is devoted to development of a neural control system for group of drones. The control system estimates the environmental complexity, selects the best path planning algorithm, and plans the path of the copters. Algorithm of the complexity estimation is a logical classification of the environmental state. The complexity depends of obstacle’s location in the environment. Selection of the best path planning algorithm is a neural classification of the environment. The neural network selects the best path planning algorithm from two algorithms. The first one is the shortest path planning algorithm, and the second one is the safest path planning algorithm. A hybrid learning algorithm is proposed for the neural classifier of the environment. This learning algorithm consists of a supervised and an unsupervised unit. Evaluation of the neural classifier is performed by the multi criterion including the motion time, the path length, and the minimal distance from the path to the obstacles. The path planning algorithms are implemented by neural networks also. These networks are trained by supervised algorithms. The neural planner output is the next desired location of the drone, but not whole path to the target point. This approach allows the group of drones to operate in a dynamical environment without recalculating the whole path. Also this research proposes algorithms of drone’s formation in an uncertain unmapped 3-D environment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Deep learning algorithms and multicriteria-based decision-making have effective applications in big data. Derivations are made based on the use of deep algorithms and multicriteria. Due to its effectiveness and potentiality, it is exploited in several domains such as computer science and information technology, agriculture, and business sector. The aim of the proposed study is to present a systematic literature study in order to show the applications of deep learning algorithms and multicriteria decision approaches for the problems of big data. The research finds novel means to make the decision support system for the problems of big data using multiple criteria in integration with machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches. © 2020 Mei Yang et al.},

abstract={Background: Road accidents have become a major social and health problem for being dramatically increasing day after day worldwide. Scientists are conducting their studies to define the main attributes that share the severity of road accidents. Finding a new approach to analyze road accidents is of great urgency. Data mining techniques are best fitting to discover useful information out of enormous data which are used to make proactive decisions. Methods: This paper tempts a rule-based machine learning method known as association rule mining, which can identify strong rules discovered in databases using interesting measures. Given a da-ta-set from the Lebanese territory for the years 2016-2017, the application of association rule mining, the Apriori method takes its place. However, its implementation leads to a very large number of rules. The task that is the most difficult is extracting meaningful and non-redundant rules. In order to find out the most interesting and relevant rules out of fatal rules such, ELECTRE TRI and PROME-THEE methods, the most significant methods of decision making, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) are integrated to resolve the outranking problem. The integration is presented by the use of the same set of weights and the same constant values of Indifference and Preference thresholds used in ELECTRE-TRI method to define the linear preference function needed by PROMETHEE method. Realizing the sensitivity of the final output of alternatives ranking to the changes of the input parameters of the decision-making tool, this proposed integration helps the decision makers to overcome their ambivalence between preference and indifference thresholds and to cope adequately with the issue of the uncertainty of MCDA procedures; it comes up with the complete ranking of rules. Results: The obtained ranked rules declare the most significant attributes or combinations of attributes that influence the severity of road accidents. Four main factors of fatal road accidents are pinpointed: over-speeding mainly leading up to rollover crashes, pedestrians encountering in the context, distracted driving leading to fatal road vehicle collisions with Pedestrian victims; and wet roads particularly in the case of single car accidents. Meanwhile, the importance of ELECRE-TRI and PROMETHEE and their integration in dealing with such complex phenomena and corresponding database with a large number of involved attributes have been validated. Conclusion: This paper studies the phenomenon of road accidents. Association rule mining has been applied to discover all possible relations between the various attributes. The integration of ELEC-TRE-TRI and PROMETHEE MCDA techniques aims at extracting meaningful information from the big dataset. The obtained results have shown how influencing the behavior of the driver is on the occurrence of fatal road accidents. These findings contribute to supporting decision makers to draw new design conceptions for road infrastructure and develop preventive measures that improve road safety in Lebanon. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={This book acquaints readers with a range of techniques to help them effectively identify, record, map, analyze and report on patterns in various dimensions of human development (HD) with spatial scales down to the village level. It is impossible to capture HD at the local and global scale with only a single index, because differences in HD at the international scale are caused by ‘general’ factors, whereas local-scale differences are influenced by ‘specific’ factors. This book offers a variety of methods for scientifically mapping HD at any spatial scale. It covers how to rationally select variables; how to test the models; how to validate the results, and how to analyze them. For this purpose, it employs a case study on an Indian district. The socio-economic factors regulating the patterns of HD are now more complex than they were only a few decades ago, making it essential to incorporate newer models in order to successfully ‘replicate’ the real-world situation. Accordingly, the book offers essential methodological tools & techniques for mapping HD. It sheds new light on a handful of statistical multivariate analysis and machine learning algorithms that are rarely used in the social sciences when dealing with HD, yet have sound mathematical and statistical bases. These techniques can be successfully used for predictive analysis in the earth & natural sciences, decision sciences and management disciplines, and are equally effective in terms of capturing, predicting and projecting the composite HD ‘landscape.' This book will especially benefit two groups of readers: firstly, HD practitioners who want to find out ‘why some areas are doing better than others’ by exploring the complex interactions of spatially linked variables with different HD parameters. And secondly, practitioners in other branches of the social sciences who are not concerned with HD but are looking for ‘hands-on training’ with techniques they can apply in their respective field of spatial investigations. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

abstract={An efficient supply chain is the backbone of any successful business. Such efficient supply chain relies on the performance of its suppliers and partners. Alignment of priorities is critical for strategic partnership. An enterprise can create greater value for their products and services by ensuring that their service providers and partners share common priorities and are willing to adjust their operations to meet the common goals. Careful partner evaluation based on quantifiable performance indicators is necessary. Conflicting criteria are typical in such partner evaluations. The AI-based solution explained in this paper leverages machine’s ability to perform complex multi-level, multi-criteria-based ranking decisions. It allows decision makers to configure business criteria which are important to meet their goals. Behind the scene multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) algorithms perform partner and quote ranking based on the latest uploaded request for quote (RFQ) responses and user-defined configuration setting of important business criteria, their relative importance and monotonicity. The proposed system also simulates your spend portfolio by changing the business distribution across various partners and service levels to achieve most optimal results prior to temporary or final award. The solution proposed optimizes your spend portfolio, strengthen your partner relationship and create greater value for your products and services. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

Algorithms for finding routes between charging stations on a graph are improved. The multicriteria problem of choosing the optimal solution by the method of global criterion is solved. Charging stations can be selected depending on the charging time and the number of charging stations. We use the object-oriented approach for information systems design. The application requirements are justified. Considering the features of the iOS platform, the REST architecture was used. Test analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the program.

abstract={Disparate natural and artificial systems are modelled as complex networks to understand their structural properties and dynamics of phenomena occurring on them. Identification of key components (nodes) of a complex network and ranking them has both theoretical and practical applications. The node ranking techniques are compared on three categories of criteria, namely, Differentiation, Accuracy and Computational Efficiency. Having multiple criteria for technique selection and a number of alternative ranking techniques available renders ranking technique selection in the domain of complex networks as Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. A number of MCDM methods are accessible in the literature, but no treatment is available for the selection of node ranking techniques based on systematic decision making. In this paper, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), followed by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), are used in tandem to propose a framework that objectively compares and select node ranking techniques for complex networks. The working of the proposed framework is demonstrated with a dataset of complex networks. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Nowadays, coronavirus (COVID-19) is getting international attention due it considered as a life-threatened epidemic disease that hard to control the spread of infection around the world. Machine learning (ML) is one of intelligent technique that able to automatically predict the event with reasonable accuracy based on the experience and learning process. In the meantime, a rapid number of ML models have been proposed for predicate the cases of COVID-19. Thus, there is need for an evaluation and benchmarking of COVID-19 ML models which considered the main challenge of this study. Furthermore, there is no single study have addressed the problem of evaluation and benchmarking of COVID diagnosis models. However, this study proposed an intelligent methodology is to help the health organisations in the selection COVID-19 diagnosis system. The benchmarking and evaluation of diagnostic models for COVID-19 is not a trivial process. There are multiple criteria requires to evaluate and some of the criteria are conflicting with each other. Our study is formulated as a decision matrix (DM) that embedded mix of ten evaluation criteria and twelve diagnostic models for COVID-19. The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method is employed to evaluate and benchmarking the different diagnostic models for COVID19 with respect to the evaluation criteria. An integrated MCDM method are proposed where TOPSIS applied for the benchmarking and ranking purpose while Entropy used to calculate the weights of criteria. The study results revealed that the benchmarking and selection problems associated with COVID19 diagnosis models can be effectively solved using the integration of Entropy and TOPSIS. The SVM (linear) classifier is selected as the best diagnosis model for COVID19 with the closeness coefficient value of 0.9899 for our case study data. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has solved the significant variance for each criterion in terms of ideal best and worst best value, beside issue when specific diagnosis models have same ideal best value. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The paper describes development of a multi-criteria decision support system (MCDSS) to improve the quality of school education. It is proposed to apply interpretable machine learning models for making decisions on improving the quality of education in secondary schools. Existing DSS are based on the expert judgement, which can be subjective. In addition, the large amount of data and features makes manual analysis difficult. Our approach is referred to as MCDSS with “black boxes” explainer, it consists of three stages. First, we develop the target indicators that measure the quality of education. A set of four features of quality of education (Q-Edu) has been developed. Secondly, we build regression models that link the data of the national educational database (NEDB) with target indicators. Thirdly, we use machine learning model interpreters to develop recommendations. The disadvantage associated with the difficulties of interpreting the results of models is overcome by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which is used as a basis for developing recommendations for what features of educational institution could be altered in order to improve quality indicators. Using the described process, we, in particular, revealed the positive impact of the location of the school, ratio of experienced teachers, sports, technical and art studios on Q-Edu indicators. The ratio of experienced teachers and, at the same time, young teachers younger than 25 year positively affects the number of significant student achievements. The proposed universal approach reduces the subjectivity and laboriousness of parameter significance determination in MCDSS. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={For a centralized retail chain where everything is controlled centrally for all the outlets, to monitor the performances of all outlets and identify the problems in product level, is difficult than in a decentralized retail chain. A centralized retail chain having twenty-two outlets and eight thousand six hundred and ninety-three unique products, has been considered for this study. In this paper, we used K-mean clustering as a machine learning tool to cluster the outlets from where we measured each cluster's performance. To further analyze at product level, we used analytical hierarchy process (AHP), as multi criteria decision-making technique, for cluster wise inventory classification. Revenue per square foot and average basket value for each cluster, is the basic performance indicator. From basic performance indicator, decision makers can get an idea about which cluster needs immediate attention. This will lead them to investigate that cluster's class wise inventory situation for performance improvement. © Interconnected Supply Chains in an Era of Innovation - Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Information Systems, Logistics and Supply Chain, ILS 2020.

abstract={Python has become the programming language of choice for research and industry projects related to data science, machine learning, and deep learning. Since optimization is an inherent part of these research fields, more optimization related frameworks have arisen in the past few years. Only a few of them support optimization of multiple conflicting objectives at a time, but do not provide comprehensive tools for a complete multi-objective optimization task. To address this issue, we have developed pymoo, a multi-objective optimization framework in Python. We provide a guide to getting started with our framework by demonstrating the implementation of an exemplary constrained multi-objective optimization scenario. Moreover, we give a high-level overview of the architecture of pymoo to show its capabilities followed by an explanation of each module and its corresponding sub-modules. The implementations in our framework are customizable and algorithms can be modified/extended by supplying custom operators. Moreover, a variety of single, multi- and many-objective test problems are provided and gradients can be retrieved by automatic differentiation out of the box. Also, pymoo addresses practical needs, such as the parallelization of function evaluations, methods to visualize low and high-dimensional spaces, and tools for multi-criteria decision making.

abstract={Electronic word-of-mouth (EWOM) is playing an important part in the consumer’s purchasing decision making across various shopping platforms. This is especially true in service sector, where the feedbacks covering the guest experience influence the adoption intention of potential consumers. The online ratings of various service aspects of the hotels posted by earlier users provide a comprehensive evaluation of their opinions and assessments on a standardized scale. In order to maximize utility, customers look for various candidate alternatives as well as the online ratings corresponding to it. This requires making a mathematical justification for precise decision making. Moreover, purchasing decisions incorporate hesitation among customers. To take care of these problems, this paper proposes a model applying multi criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques with online ratings of hotel. The objective of the paper is to rank hotels on the basis of online ratings of their attributes available on Tripadvisor. Firstly, the priorities of the service attributes, in the form of weights, are obtained using Neutrosophic Analytic Hierarchy Process (NAHP). The Neutrosophic set are an extension of fuzzy concept and has the advantage of handling hesitation in decision making process. We apply stochastic dominance along with the preference weights on the available ratings to obtain a comparison matrix of alternative. Finally, we make use of PROMETHEE technique to get the overall ranking of hotels. Future studies may include the role of online review text in the present model. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, the subject of the research is the intelligent forecasting in multi-criteria decision-making, in particular, methods of prediction of time series: traditional models of autoregression, smoothing techniques and machine learning methods with the use of artificial neural networks and deep learning. Time series of Amazon share prices from the official sources over the past years serve as a base for exploration. The purpose of the work is to find out the parameters that influence the efficiency and accuracy of models for analysis and forecast the share prices. Such assessment is complicated and vital because various types of criteria, in particular, sales and profitability, market indexes, exchange rates and general trends, etc., usually influence the decision-making process. The methods of research include the consideration and analysis of prediction methods using specific metrics. The relevance of the topic assumes that the accurate prediction at the financial market may contribute to the financial benefits for companies, government and other players on stock exchanges. A comparative analysis of the considered forecasting methods was conducted. It allows choosing the most appropriate intellectual method for increasing the efficiency of a specific share price prediction. The further development of the subject of research includes ensemble-learning methods for neural networks, feature engineering, collecting a more extensive data set for forecasting.

abstract={Recent developments in the field of recommender systems have led to a renewed interest in employing some of the sophisticated machine learning algorithms to combine multiple characteristics of items during the process of making recommendations. Considerable number of research papers have been published on multi-criteria recommendation techniques. Most of these studies have focused only on using some basic statistical methods or simply by extending the similarity computation of the traditional heuristic-based techniques to model the system. Researchers have not treated the uncertainty that exists about the relationship between multi-criteria modelling approaches and effectiveness of some of the complex and powerful machine learning techniques; in fact, no previous study has investigated the role of artificial neural networks to design and develop the system using aggregation function approach. This paper seeks to remedy these challenges by analysing the performance of multi-criteria recommender systems, modelled by integrating an adaptive linear neuron that was trained using delta rule, and asymmetric singular value decomposition algorithms. The proposed model was implemented, trained and tested using a multi-criteria dataset for recommending movies to users based on action, story, direction, and visual effects of movies. Taken together, the empirical results of the study suggested that there is a strong association between artificial neural networks and the modelling approaches of multicriteria recommendation technique. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.},

abstract={Regardless of the costs that inventory management involves, inventories are essential to the supply chain efficiency since they secure a constant and continuous supply of parts that are necessary for continuous production. Therefore, companies are interested in finding the inventory balance that allows them to take advantage of unplanned production opportunities, and at the same time, minimizing the negative consequences of their accumulating inventory. ABC inventory classification has offered an option to inventory management based on prioritizing items. It sets a justified basis for decision-making process' assistance. This paper is aimed at presenting a new approach, for new items classification that takes into consideration multiple criteria. The proposed approach is a data mining technique called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is based on Boolean theory that is used for pattern recognition. For this study a Multi-class LAD model is used to support ABC items' classification process based on multiple criteria. Two applications for two different datasets are presented. Classification accuracy results obtained using LAD are discussed. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents an accelerated Promethee (Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations) multi-criteria algorithm based on dimensionality reduction in large scale environments. In our context, the Promethee algorithm is used to select from a large set of objects, one or a small set of objects with a good compromise between several qualitative and quantitative criteria. The exact solution can be used by applying the exact multi-criteria Promethee algorithm. However, the drawback, with this type of exact algorithm, is the long execution time due to the combinatorial aspect of the problem. The exact Promethee computing time is linked both to the dimension of the problem (number of qualitative and quantitative criteria) and the size of the problem (number of objects). To address the previous drawback, we propose to accelerate the Promethee algorithm in combining the exact Promethee algorithm with an algorithm inherited from the Machine Learning (ML) field. The experiments demonstrate the potential of our approach under different scenarios to accelerate the respond time. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With increasing amount of data generated every day, there is a need to extract useful information from the data which is an important problem to be solved. Machine learning is a method that enables the computer system to have the intelligence by analyzing the data and building an automated analytical model. The algorithms in machine learning are broadly classified as either iterative or non-iterative algorithms. An optimization algorithm plays a key role in machine learning that is solved by iterative methods that are executed iteratively to generate optimum solution or till a satisfactory solution is obtained. A non-iterative algorithm is computationally faster than iterative algorithms as it does not require iteration or little iter ation to train the data. This paper makes an analysis of these iterative and non-iterative algorithms and performs comparison upon their respective advantages and drawbacks. These algorithms are compared based on various parameters such as time taken to build the model, correctly and wrongly classified instances, mean absolute error, root means square error, true positive, false positive, precision and recall are computed. Multi Criteria Decision Making method such as TOPSIS is used to improve the efficiency of the decision making process by suggesting best machine learning technique that improves classification. © IJSTR 2020.},

abstract={This chapter describes briefly the learning and cognitive theories as well as the algorithmic techniques that have been employed for ameliorating social networking-based learning and e-learning. As a testbed for our research, we have designed and fully implemented POLYGLOT, namely a social networking-based intelligent and adaptive tutoring system for the learning foreign languages. POLYGLOT incorporates the following theories, models and techniques for providing a student-centered learning experience. Firstly, it uses the Stephen Krashen’s cognitive theory consisting of five hypotheses: the Acquisition-Learning hypothesis, the Monitor hypothesis, the Input hypothesis, the Natural Order hypothesis and the Affective Filter hypothesis. It also employs the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model, for determining the students’ learning styles. POLYGLOT holds a supervised machine learning algorithm (k-nearest neighbors algorithm) which takes as input several students’ features, including their age, gender, educational level, computer knowledge level, number of languages spoken and grade on preliminary test, in order to detect automatically their learning style. Moreover, our system incorporates a hybrid machine learning-based approach for error diagnosis, namely Approximate String Matching for conducting natural language processing and diagnosing types of students’ errors along with String Meaning Similarity for diagnosing errors due to language transfer interference. POLYGLOT also uses a machine learning-based approach for creating effective groups for students for win-win collaboration. Our system employs a dynamic model for adaptive domain knowledge delivery and personalized assessment units using multiple-criteria decision analysis. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Concerning the significant increase in the negative effects of flash-floods worldwide, the main goal of this research is to evaluate the power of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), fi (kNN), K-Star (KS) algorithms and their ensembles in flash-flood susceptibility mapping. To train the two stand-alone models and their ensembles, for the first stage, the areas affected in the past by torrential phenomena are identified using remote sensing techniques. Approximately 70% of these areas are used as a training data set along with 10 flash-flood predictors. It should be remarked that the remote sensing techniques play a crucial role in obtaining eight out of 10 flash-flood conditioning factors. The predictive capability of predictors is evaluated through the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) method. As expected, the slope angle results in the factor with the highest predictive capability. The application of the AHP model implies the construction of ten pair-wise comparison matrices for calculating the normalized weights of each flash-flood predictor. The computed weights are used as input data in kNN-AHP and KS-AHP ensemble models for calculating the Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI). The FFPI also is determined through kNN and KS stand-alone models. The performance of the models is evaluated using statistical metrics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) while the validation of the results is done by constructing the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) values and by calculating the density of torrential pixels within FFPI classes. Overall, the best performance is obtained by the kNN-AHP ensemble model. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Cloud IoT is a new paradigm that has emerged as a result of the integration of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. It provides a set of intelligent services and applications that can strongly influence on our daily lives. In the CloudIoT, physical sensors are responsible for detecting and transmitting data to the cloud in order to be treated and stored. In this context, the amount of data to be processed through the CloudIoT is in increasing usually and, in this situation, the load balancing mechanism is needed in order to distribute the captured data between the different CloudIoT resources. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows to balance the load between the different virtual machines of a CloudIoT. The proposed approach is composed of four essential components: The Classifier which assigns Tasks to its corresponding class and assigns the Virtual Machines (VM) to its corresponding class too, the Dispatcher which sends the tasks to the VM classes, the Local Balancer whose role is to balance the tasks between different VMs belonging to the same class used the spooling method for duplicate same VM, finally, the Manager component or general balancer that is responsible to balance the load between VMs classes with the test of the maximum cloud allowance bar to release VM. The results obtained through the proposed the case study show that our approach allows effectively the load balancing between VM. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Preference learning methods are commonly used in multicriteria analysis. The working principle of these methods is similar to classical machine learning techniques. A common issue to both machine learning and preference learning methods is the difficulty of the definition of decision classes and the assignment of objects to these classes, especially for large datasets. This paper proposes two procedures permitting to automatize the construction of decision classes. It also proposes two simple refinement procedures, that rely on the 80-20 principle, permitting to map the output of the construction procedures into a manageable set of decision classes. The proposed construction procedures rely on the most elementary preference relation, namely dominance relation, which avoids the need for additional information or distance/(di)similarity functions, as with most of existing clustering methods. Furthermore, the simplicity of the 80-20 principle on which the refinement procedures are based, make them very adequate to large datasets. Proposed procedures are illustrated and validated using real-world datasets. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Background: Sleep plays an essential role in repairing and healing human mental and physical health. Developing an efficient method for scoring electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stages is expected to help medical specialists in the early diagnosis of sleep disorders. Method: In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for classifying sleep stages EEG signals using correlation graphs. First, each 30 s EEG segment is divided into a set of sub-segments. The dimensionality of each sub-segment is reduced by using a statistical model. Second, each EEG segment is transferred into a graph considering each sub-segment as a node in a graph, and a link between each pair of nodes is calculated based on their correlation coefficient. Graph's modularity is used as input features into an ensemble classifier. Results: Different community detection algorithm based correlation graph are investigated to discern the most effective features to reveal the differences between EEG sleep stages. A combination of various classification techniques: a least square vector machine (LS-SVM), k-means, Naïve Bayes, Fuzzy C-means, k-nearest, and logistic regression are tested using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) to design an ensemble classifier. Based on the results of the MCDM, the best four: LS-SVM, Naïve Bayes, logistic regression and k-nearest are integrated, to finally utilise as an ensemble classifier to categorise the graph's characteristics. The results obtained from the ensemble classifier are compared with those from the individual classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state of the art of sleep stages classification. The experimental results showed that the EEG sleep classification based on correlation graphs are able to achieve better recognition results than the existing state of the art techniques. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study explored the use of participatory mapping and several machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, GMO Maxent, SVM, CART, and Random Forest) to map climate induced landslide susceptibility in Lembeh Island, North Sulawesi, based on Earth Observation data available in Google Earth Engine. Participatory mapping on landslide incidents were conducted in three villages, i.e., Kareko, Pintu Kota, and Pasir Panjang. Data used include digital elevation model from SRTM, multispectral imageries from Sentinel 2, and precipitation from CHIRPS. Terrain modelling was done to DEM to come up with elevation, slope, curvature, and aspect. A cloud free mosaic of Sentinel Images was created using the median reducer and then NDVI was calculated. Precipitation data from CHIRPS was sampled and interpolated using kriging and reduced to maximum and mean. Each algorithm was trained using 70% participatory mapping data and then the prediction was tested for accuracy using the last 30%. Results showed that Random Forest, SVM, CART, and GMO Maxent gave 0.98 testing accuracy and Naïve Bayes only 0.90. The map showed that due to the terrain condition, Lembeh Island is prone to Landslide and even though previously BNPB already provide a landslide hazard risk map, there were many areas not included on that map. Therefore, the map could become an input for BNPB and the Bitung City for developing a mitigation and adaptation strategy. Machine learning and cloud computing along with participatory mapping could also complement mechanistic or multi-criteria analysis using GIS model for landslide susceptibility mapping. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis in the knee that comes with a variation in symptoms’ intensity, frequency and pattern. Knee OA (KOA) is often diagnosed using invasive and expensive methods that can measure changes in joint morphology and function. Early and accurate identification of significant risk factors in clinical data is of vital importance in diagnosing KOA. A machine intelligence approach is proposed here to enable automated, non-invasive identification of risk factors from self-reported clinical data about joint symptoms, disability, function and general health. The proposed methodology was applied to recognize participants with symptomatic KOA or being at high risk of developing KOA in at least one knee. Different machine learning and deep learning algorithms were tested and compared in terms of multiple criteria e.g. accuracy, per class accuracy and execution time. Deep learning was proved to be the most effective in terms of accuracy with classification accuracies up to 86.95%, evaluated on data from the osteoarthritis initiative study. Insights about ten different feature subsets and their effect on classification accuracy are provided. The proposed methodology was also demonstrated in subgroups defined by gender and age. The results suggest that machine intelligence and especially deep learning may facilitate clinical evaluation, monitoring and even prediction of knee osteoarthritis. Apart from the classical implementation of the proposed methodology, a quantum perspective is also discussed highlighting the future application of quantum computers in OA diagnosis. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Many distance measures have been proposed in in the literature for vague sets, some of those measures cannot satisfy the axioms of distance or provide counterintuitive cases. For certain situations using these distance measures, analysis reveal them incapable of discriminating between vague sets. Thus, the author propose a new distance measure to overcome the limitations of existing distance measures and apply it to a group multi-criteria decision making problem using Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The new distance measure not only satisfies the axioms of distance measure, but also overcomes the counterintuitive cases. It appears thus to be a useful new distance measure between vague sets. A numerical example, as presented, augers well for practical adoption of the proposed distance measure for handling MCDM problem using TOPSIS method. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Supplier assessment plays a critical role in the supply chain management, which involves the flow of goods and services from the initial stage (raw material procurement) to the final stage (delivery). Supplier assessment is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that requires several criteria for the proper assessment of the suppliers. When there are several criteria involved, it makes the supplier assessment process more complicated. For a comprehensive and robust assessment process, we propose the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to classify various suppliers into four categories: excellent, good, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory. In this paper, supervised learning (classification) algorithms are applied for a supplier assessment problem where a model is trained based on the previous historical data and then tested on the new unseen data set. This method will provide an efficient way for supplier assessment that is more effective in terms of accuracy and time when compared to MCDM approach. Classification algorithms such as support vector machines (with linear, polynomial and radial basis kernels), logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and naïve Bayes methods are used to train the model and their performance is assessed against a test data. Finally, the performance measures from all the classification methods are used to assess the best supplier. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Groundwater is one of the most important natural resources, as it regulates the earth's hydrological system. The Damghan sedimentary plain area, located in the region of a semi-arid climate of Iran, has very critical conditions of groundwater due to massive pressure on it and is in need of robust models for identifying the groundwater potential zones (GWPZ). The main goal of the current research is to prepare a groundwater potentiality map (GWPM) considering the probabilistic, machine learning, data mining, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches. For this purpose, 80 wells collected from the Iranian groundwater resource department and field investigation with global positioning system (GPS), have been selected randomly and considered as the groundwater inventory datasets. Out of 80 wells, 56 (70%) wells have been brought into play for modeling and 24 (30%) for validation purposes. Elevation, slope, aspect, convergence index (CI), rainfall, drainage density (Dd), distance to river, distance to fault, distance to road, lithology, soil type, land use/land cover (LU/LC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), and stream power index (SPI) have been used for modeling purpose. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), accuracy (AC), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are used for checking the goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy of approaches to compare their performance. In addition, the influence of groundwater determining factors (GWDFs) on groundwater occurrence was evaluated by performing a sensitivity analysis model. The GWPMs, produced by technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), random forest (RF), binary logistic regression (BLR), weight of evidence (WoE) and support vector machine (SVM) have been classified into four categories, i.e., low, medium, high and very high groundwater potentiality with the help of the natural break classification methods in the GIS environment. The very high groundwater potentiality class is covered 15.09% for TOPSIS, 15.46% for WoE, 25.26% for RF, 15.47% for BLR, and 18.74% for SVM of the entire plain area. Based on sensitivity analysis, distance from river, and drainage density represent significantly effects on the groundwater occurrence. validation results show that the BLR model with best prediction accuracy and goodness-of-fit outperforms the other five models. Although, all models have very good performance in modeling of groundwater potential. Results of seed cell area index model that used for checking accuracy classification of models show that all models have suitable performance. Therefore, these are promising models that can be applied for the GWPZs identification, which will help for some needful action of these areas. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This work proposes a new approach by integrating statistical, machine learning, and multi-criteria decision analysis, including artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), frequency ratio (FR), and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Dependent (flood inventory) and independent variables (flood causative factors) were prepared using remote sensing data and the Mike-11 hydrological model and secondary data from different sources. The flood inventory map was randomly divided into training and testing datasets, where 334 flood locations (70%) were used for training and the remaining 141 locations (30%) were employed for testing. Using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), predictive power of the model was tested. The results revealed that LR model had the highest success rate (81.60%) and prediction rate (86.80%), among others. Furthermore, different combinations of the models were evaluated for flood susceptibility mapping and the best combination (11C) was used for generating a new flood hazard map for Bangladesh. The performance of the 11C integrated models was also evaluated using the AUROC and found that integrated LR-FR model had the highest predictive power with an AUROC value of 88.10%.

abstract={As a field of research arc fault detection in domestic appliances has existed for a long time and many detection algorithms have been published, patterned or implemented on commercial products. None of them, however, guarantees perfect discrimination and all are susceptible to false negatives or false positives (i.e. indicating the absence of arcing fault, when in reality it is present, or recognizing normal functioning as an arcing condition). This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that all methods have been based on some features of arc fault which can be shared with load and network conditions such as noisy loads, the plugging-in or unplugging of appliances, the change of functioning mode of an appliance on a network and so on. A solution for limiting this phenomenon is multi arc-fault feature recognition. This research presents a method for finding and combining arc fault features in order to obtain better performance than using a single arc fault feature. The choice of arc-fault features and the algorithm for combining them are based on machine learning techniques. The method proposed here can be used for different network conditions and loads. The effectiveness of this method has been verified by a number of experimental tests including not only the requirements of standard arc fault detection, but also the most difficult situations such as multiple loads masking and transient loads. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Online discussions about software applications and services that take place on web-based communication platforms represent an invaluable knowledge source for diverse software engineering tasks, including requirements elicitation. The amount of research work on developing effective tool-supported analysis methods is rapidly increasing, as part of the so called software analytics. Textual messages in App store reviews, tweets, online discussions taking place in mailing lists and user forums, are processed by combining natural language techniques to filter out irrelevant data; text mining and machine learning algorithms to classify messages into different categories, such as bug report and feature request. Our research objective is to exploit a linguistic technique based on speech-acts for the analysis of online discussions with the ultimate goal of discovering requirements-relevant information. In this paper, we present a revised and extended version of the speech-acts based analysis technique, which we previously presented at CAiSE 2017, together with a detailed experimental characterisation of its properties. Datasets used in the experimental evaluation are taken from a widely used open source software project (161120 textual comments), as well as from an industrial project in the home energy management domain. We make them available for experiment replication purposes. On these datasets, our approach is able to successfully classify messages into Feature/Enhancement and Other, with F-measure of 0.81 and 0.84 respectively. We also found evidence that there is an association between types of speech-acts and categories of issues, and that there is correlation between some of the speech-acts and issue priority, thus motivating further research on the exploitation of our speech-acts based analysis technique in semi-automated multi-criteria requirements prioritisation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia.

abstract={Objective: Motivated by the well documented worldwide spread of adverse drug events, as well as the increased danger of antibiotic resistance (caused mainly by inappropriate prescribing and overuse), we propose a novel recommendation system for antibiotic prescription (PARS). Method: Our approach is based on the combination of semantic technologies with MCDA (Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding) that allowed us to build a two level decision support model. Given a specific domain, the approach assesses the adequacy of an alternative/action (prescription of antibiotic) for a specific subject (patient) with an issue (bacterial infection) in a given context (medical). The goal of the first level of the decision support model is to select the set of alternatives which have the potential to be suitable. Then the second level sorts the alternatives into categories according to their adequacy using an MCDA sorting method (MR–Sort with Veto) and a structured set of description logic queries. Results: We applied this approach in the domain of antibiotic prescriptions, working closely with the EpiCura Hospital Center (BE). Its performance was compared to the EpiCura recommendation guidelines which are currently in use. The results showed that the proposed system is more consistent in its recommendations when compared with the static EpiCura guidelines. Moreover, with PARS the antibiotic prescribing workflow becomes more flexible. PARS allows the user (physician) to update incrementally and dynamically a patient's profile with more information, or to input knowledge modifications that accommodate the decision context (like the introduction of new side effects and antibiotics, the development of germs that are resistant, etc). At the end of our evaluation, we detail a number of limitations of the current version of PARS and discuss future perspectives. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The Social Web promotes social interactions among people through Web 2.0 technologies. In this context, User-Generated Content (UGC) spreads across social media platforms in the absence of traditional intermediaries that can verify both the believability of the content and the reliability of the sources that generated it. For this reason, the problem of how to assess the credibility of UGC is receiving nowadays increasing attention. In the literature, several approaches have tackled this issue mainly as a classification problem, by categorizing information into genuine and fake. The majority of the proposed solutions follows a data-driven approach, by employing supervised or semi-supervised machine learning techniques that act on multiple features related to credibility. Despite its effectiveness, however, machine learning may present some possible drawbacks, including data-dependency and the possible inscrutability of the contribution that single or interacting features have in the final classification process. In this paper, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach is proposed, aimed to assess the credibility of UGC. A given information item (alternative) is evaluated with respect to the considered credibility features (criteria) based on prior domain knowledge, where an overall credibility estimate is obtained by means of a suitable model-driven approach based on aggregation operators. The credibility estimate allows to classify credible UGC with respect to non-credible one, and can also be used to provide a ranking of the alternatives with respect to credibility. To consider interactions among features, the Choquet integral is employed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Travelers can enjoy a wide range of choices with the assistance of online review websites such as TripAdvisor. Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Forest fires threaten a large part of the world's forests, communities, and industrial plants, triggering technological accidents (Natechs). Forest fire modelling with respect to contributing spatial parameters is one of the well-known ways not only to predict the fire occurrence in forests, but also to assess the risk of forest-fire-induced Natechs. This study is a review of methods based on geospatial information system (GIS) for modelling forest fires and their potential Natechs that have been implemented all over the world. The present study conducts a systematic literature review of the methods used for forest fire susceptibility, hazard, and risk assessment, while dividing them into four general categories: (a) statistical and data-driven models; (b) machine learning models; (c) multi-criteria decision-making models, and (d) ensemble models. In addition, some forest fire detection techniques using satellite imagery are reviewed. A comparison is also conducted to highlight the research gaps and required future research. The results of the present research assist decision makers to select the most appropriate techniques according to specific forest conditions. Results show that data-driven approaches are the most frequently applied methods while ensemble approaches are more accurate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the life cycle of software product development, the software effort estimation (SEE) has always been a critical activity. The researchers have proposed numerous estimation methods since the inception of software engineering as a research area. The diversity of estimation approaches is very high and increasing, but it has been interpreted that no single technique performs consistently for each project and environment. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach generates more credible estimates, which is subjected to expert’s experience. In this paper, a hybrid model has been developed to combine MCDM (for handling uncertainty) and machine learning algorithm (for handling imprecision) approach to predict the effort more accurately. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) has been used effectively for feature ranking. Ranks generated from FAHP have been integrated into weighted kernel least square support vector machine for effort estimation. The model developed has been empirically validated on data repositories available for SEE. The combination of weights generated by FAHP and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel has resulted in more accurate effort estimates in comparison with bee colony optimisation and basic RBF kernel-based model. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Traffic classification in computer networks has very significant roles in network operation, management, and security. Examples include controlling the flow of information, allocating resources effectively, provisioning quality of service, detecting intrusions, and blocking malicious and unauthorized access. This problem has attracted a growing attention over years and a number of techniques have been proposed ranging from traditional port-based and payload inspection of TCP/IP packets to supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised machine learning paradigms. With the increasing complexity of network environments and support for emerging mobility services and applications, more robust and accurate techniques need to be investigated. In this paper, we propose a new supervised hybrid machine-learning approach for ubiquitous traffic classification based on multicriteria fuzzy decision trees with attribute selection. Moreover, our approach can handle well the imbalanced datasets and zero-day applications (i.e., those without previously known traffic patterns). Evaluating the proposed methodology on several benchmark real-world traffic datasets of different nature demonstrated its capability to effectively discriminate a variety of traffic patterns, anomalies, and protocols for unencrypted and encrypted traffic flows. Comparing with other methods, the performance of the proposed methodology showed remarkably better classification accuracy. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Gully erosion is considered as a severe environmental problem in many areas of the world which causes huge damages to agricultural lands and infrastructures (i.e. roads, buildings, and bridges); however, gully erosion modeling and prediction with high accuracy are still difficult due to the complex interactions of various factors. The objective of this research was to develop and introduce three new ensemble models, which were based on Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives (COPRAS), Logistic Regression (LR), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Random Forest (RF), and Frequency Ratio (FR) for spatial prediction of gully erosion with a case study at the Najafabad watershed (Iran). For this purpose, a total of 290 head-cut of gullies and 17 conditioning factors were collected and used to establish a geospatial database. Subsequently, FR was used to determine the spatial relationship between the conditioning factors and the head-cut of gullies, whereas RF, BRT, and LR were used to quantify the relative importance of these factors. In the next step, three ensemble gully erosion models, named COPRAS-FR-RF, COPRAS-FR-BRT, and COPRAS-FR-LR were developed and verified. The Success Rate Curve (SRC), and the Prediction Rate Curve (PRC) and their areas under the curves (AUC) were used to check the performance of the three proposed models. The result showed that Soil group, geomorphology, and drainage density factors played the key role on the occurrence of the gully erosion. All the three models have very high degree-of-fit and the prediction performance, the COPRAS-FR-RF model (AUC-SRC = 0.974 and AUC-PRC = 0.929), the COPRAS-FR-BRT model (AUC-SRC = 0.973 and AUC-PRC = 0.928), and the COPRAS-FR-LR model (AUC-SRC = 0.972 and AUC-PRC = 0.926); therefore, it is concluded that they are efficient and new powerful tools which could be used for predicting gully erosion in prone-areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Polarimetric features of PolSAR images include inherent scattering mechanisms of terrain types, which are important for classification and other Earth observation applications. By using target decomposition methods, many polarimetric scattering components can be obtained. Besides, the elements of a coherency/covariance matrix, as well as polarimetric descriptors, such as SPAN, single-bounce eigenvalue relative difference/double-bounce eigenvalue relative difference, etc., can also provide characteristic information. In fact, more and more polarimetric decomposition components and descriptors have been proposed; the computation cost increases if all of them are employed as the input of the classification process. Although all these features obtained from the coherency/covariance matrix are not independent, still, finding out which ones are significant for the classification of different terrain types will improve the understanding of scattering mechanisms. In this article, the effective polarimetric feature combination is studied based on the vegetation classification performance of support vector machine (SVM) and nearest-regularized subspace (NRS) machine learning approaches, as well as their combinations with a Markov random field (MRF). A framework on the basis of similarity and the orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) method in a hyperspectral area is used to select the polarimetric features. For the airborne PolSAR data in Flevoland, The Netherlands, 107 polarimetric features are extracted, including matrix elements, target decomposition components, and polarimetric descriptors. A subset is selected by using the proposed and OSP methods. They have a good classification accuracy evaluated by SVM+MRF and NRS+MRF classifiers.

abstract={After more than a decade, the supply-driven approach to publishing public (open) data has resulted in an ever-growing number of data silos. Hundreds of thousands of datasets have been catalogued and can be accessed at data portals at different administrative levels. However, usually, users do not think in terms of datasets when they search for information. Instead, they are interested in information that is most likely scattered across several datasets. In the world of proprietary incompany data, organizations invest heavily in connecting data in knowledge graphs and/or store data in data lakes with the intention of having an integrated view of the data for analysis. With the rise of machine learning, it is a common belief that governments can improve their services, for example, by allowing citizens to get answers related to government information from virtual assistants like Alexa or Siri. To provide high-quality answers, these systems need to be fed with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we share our experience of constructing and using the first open government knowledge graph in the Netherlands. Based on the developed demonstrators, we elaborate on the value of having such a graph and demonstrate its use in the context of improved data browsing, multicriteria analysis for urban planning, and the development of location-aware chat bots. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In the last few years, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to solve engineering problems. However, owing to certain complexities found in real-world problems, such as class imbalance, classical learning algorithms may not reach a prescribed performance. There can be situations where a good result on different conflicting objectives is desirable, such as true positive and true negative ratios, or it is important to balance model's complexity and prediction score. To solve such issues, the application of multi-objective optimization design procedures can be used to analyze various trade-offs and build more robust machine learning models. Thus, the creation of ensembles of predictive models using such procedures is addressed in this work. First, a set of diverse predictive models is built by employing a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Next, a second multi-objective optimization step selects the previous models as ensemble members, resulting on several non-dominated solutions. A final multi-criteria decision making stage is applied to rank and visualize the resulting ensembles. To analyze the proposed methodology, two different experiments are conducted for binary classification. The first case study is a famous classification problem through which the proposed procedure is illustrated. The second one is a challenging real-world problem related to water quality monitoring, where the proposed procedure is compared to four classical ensemble learning algorithms. Results on this second experiment show that the proposed technique is able to create robust ensembles that can outperform other ensemble methods. Overall, the authors conclude that the proposed methodology for ensemble generation creates competitive models for real-world engineering problems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Forests fires in northern Iran have always been common, but the number of forest fires has been growing over the last decade. It is believed, but not proven, that this growth can be attributed to the increasing temperatures and droughts. In general, the vulnerability to forest fire depends on infrastructural and social factors whereby the latter determine where and to what extent people and their properties are affected. In this paper, a forest fire susceptibility index and a social/infrastructural vulnerability index were developed using a machine learning (ML) method and a geographic information system multi-criteria decision making (GIS-MCDM), respectively. First, a forest fire inventory database was created from an extensive field survey and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product for 2012 to 2017. A forest fire susceptibility map was generated using 16 environmental variables and a k-fold cross-validation (CV) approach. The infrastructural vulnerability index was derived with emphasis on different types of construction and land use, such as residential, industrial, and recreation areas. This dataset also incorporated social vulnerability indicators, e.g., population, age, gender, and family information. Then, GIS-MCDM was used to assess risk areas considering the forest fire susceptibility and the social/infrastructural vulnerability maps. As a result, most high fire susceptibility areas exhibit minor social/infrastructural vulnerability. The resulting forest fire risk map reveals that 729.61 ha, which is almost 1.14% of the study areas, is categorized in the high forest fire risk class. The methodology is transferable to other regions by localisation of the input data and the social indicators and contributes to forest fire mitigation and prevention planning. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={The increasing competition among industries has led to the emergence of numerous tools and methods to support decision making focused on assets maintenance in a company, since ensuring good maintenance is directly linked with greater reliability and uptime for equipment, reducing losses in production processes and consequently increasing profitability. This work aims to use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms - Bayesian Networks (BN) and attribute relevance analysis (ARA), implemented in the Weka® platform, to process a dataset of event logs failure of industrial machine components. The approach aims to use the conditional probability relations generated by the BN and the ranking of criteria relevance for the design of an AHP decision-making model within the scope of industrial maintenance to prioritize which components of a specific machine are more susceptible to failures. The proposed integration mechanism aims to bring greater reliability to the weights assigned to the criteria of the AHP model, and consequently, a more accurate decision support. The results showed that the AHP model generated from a Bayesian Network is consistent with the conditional probabilities estimated by the BN, giving robustness to the decision sphere in the context of industrial maintenance. This AHP model can serve as a basis to be complemented by qualitative analysis criteria according to the need of the individual specialist, allowing the construction of strategic maintenance action plans. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={ABC classification is a technique widely used by companies to deal with inventories consisting of very large numbers of distinct stock keeping units. Single-criterion ABC classification methods are often used in practice and recently multi-criteria methods have attracted the attention of academics and practitioners. Several models have been developed to deal with the multi-criteria ABC inventory classification (MCIC). To the best of our knowledge, very few researches have used the unsupervised machine learning methods to address the MCIC problem despite their attractive theoretical and practical properties. Therefore, in this paper, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is proposed to deal with the multi-criteria ABC inventory classification problem. GMM is a simple optimization model that can be used for classification purposes with a low computational time. A numerical investigation of the cost-service inventory of the GMM model is presented in this paper. The performance of the model is also compared to some mathematical programming-based MCIC models. The numerical study is conducted by means of a theoretical dataset, consisting of 47 stock keeping units, which has been commonly used in the literature. The numerical results show that the proposed model can have a promised performance along with the existing MCIC classification models in the literature in terms of the cost-service inventory efficiency. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Context and background: Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases threatening the human lives globally, requiring effective and early risk analysis for which learning classifiers supported with automated feature selection offer a potential robust solution. Motivation: Computer aided risk analysis of breast cancer typically works with a set of extracted mammographic features which may contain significant redundancy and noise, thereby requiring technical developments to improve runtime performance in both computational efficiency and classification accuracy. Hypothesis: Use of advanced feature selection methods based on multiple diagnosis criteria may lead to improved results for mammographic risk analysis. Methods: An approach for multi-criterion based mammographic risk analysis is proposed, by adapting the recently developed multi-label fuzzy-rough feature selection mechanism. Results: A system for multi-criterion mammographic risk analysis is implemented with the aid of multi-label fuzzy-rough feature selection and its performance is positively verified experimentally, in comparison with representative popular mechanisms. Conclusions: The novel approach for mammographic risk analysis based on multiple criteria helps improve classification accuracy using selected informative features, without suffering from the redundancy caused by such complex criteria, with the implemented system demonstrating practical efficacy. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Understanding human mobility is significant in many fields, such as geography, transportation, and sociology. Due to the wide spatiotemporal coverage and low operational cost, mobile phone data have been recognized as a major resource for human mobility research. However, due to conflicts between the data sparsity problem of mobile phone data and the requirement of fine-scale solutions, trajectory reconstruction is of considerable importance. Although there have been initial studies on this problem, existing methods rarely consider the effect of similarities among individuals and the patterns of missing data. To address this issue, we propose a multi-criteria data partitioning trajectory reconstruction (MDP-TR) method for large-scale mobile phone data. In the proposed method, a multi-criteria data partitioning (MDP) technique is used to measure the similarity among individuals in near real-time and investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of missing data. With this technique, the trajectory reconstruction from mobile phone data is then conducted with machine learning models. We verified the method using a real mobile phone dataset in a large city. Results indicate that the MDP-TR method outperforms competing methods in both accuracy and robustness. We argue that the MDP-TR method can be effectively utilized for grasping highly dynamic human movement status and improving the spatiotemporal resolution of human mobility research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A multi-criteria decision-making approach was used for the selection of GCMs for Nigeria based on their ability to replicate historical rainfall estimated using three entropy-based feature selection methods namely, Entropy Gain (EG), Gain Ratio (GR), and Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU). Performances of four bias correction methods were compared to identify the most suitable method for downscaling and projection of rainfall using the selected GCMs. Random forest (RF) regression was used for the generation of the multi-model ensemble (MME) average of projected rainfall. The ensemble projections for each of the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 were computed and compared with global precipitation climatology centre (GPCC) historical rainfall of Nigeria to assess the percentage changes in annual rainfall with 95% level of confidence at different ecological zones for three future periods 2010–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099. Quantile regression was used to assess the changes in seasonal rainfall at 95% confidence interval over the present century. The results revealed that MRI-CGCM3, HadGEM2-ES, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 and CESM1-CAM5 are the most suitable GCMs for the projection of rainfall in Nigeria. The linear scaling method was found as the most suitable approach for downscaling of rainfall in terms of all the statistical indices used. It was found to downscale rainfall with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) in the range of 30.7–44.0%, while Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) was between 0.81 and 0.91, and modified coefficient of agreement (md) was between 0.82 and 0.88. Projection of rainfall showed no significant change in Nigeria over the century under RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 6.5, while RCP 8.5 showed a decrease in the last part of the century (2070–2099). The seasonal changes in rainfall showed an increase in rainfall in the range of 0–20% in most parts of the north. The methodology in this study can reduce the uncertainty inherent in climate change projection and produce better projection of possible spatial and temporal changes in annual and seasonal rainfall. © 2019},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to perform a systematic review on the application of different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods in solving the site selection problem across multiple problem domains. The domains are energy generation, logistics, public services and retail facilities. This study aims to answer the following research questions: Which evaluating criteria were used for each site selection problem domain? Which MCDM methods were frequently applied in a particular site selection problem domain? Design/methodology/approach: The goals of the systematic review were to identify the evaluating criteria as well as the MCDM method used for each problem domain. A total of 81 recent papers (2014–2018) including 32 papers published in conference proceedings and 49 journal articles from various databases including IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Springer, Taylor and Francis as well as ScienceDirect were evaluated. Findings: This study has shown that site selection for energy generation facilities is the most active site selection problem domain, and that the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is the most commonly used MCDM method for site selection. For energy generation, the criteria which were most used were geographical elements, land use, cost and environmental impact. For logistics, frequently used criteria were geographical elements and distance, while for public services population density, supply and demand, geographical layout and cost were the criteria most used. Criteria useful for retail facilities were the size (space) of the store, demographics of the site, the site characteristics and rental of the site (cost). Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to reviewing papers which were published in the years 2014–2018 only, and only covers the domains of energy generation, logistics, public services and retail facilities. Practical implications: MCDM is a viable tool to be used for solving the site selection problem across the domains of energy generation, logistics, public services and retail facilities. The usage of MCDM continues to be relevant as a complement to machine learning, even as data originating from embedded IoT devices in built environments becomes increasingly Big Data like. Originality/value: Previous systematic review studies for MDCM and built environments have either focused on studying the MCDM techniques itself, or have focused on the application of MCDM for site selection in a single problem domain. In this study, a critical review of MCDM techniques used for site selection as well as the critical criteria used during the MCDM process of site selection was performed on four different built environment domains. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study evaluated both artificial neural network (ANN)and adaptive, network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)algorithms in conjunction with statistical modelling to predict green or grey transformation likelihoods for derelict sites (DS)and vacant sites along waterway corridors (WWC)in Manchester based on ecological, environmental, and social criteria. The soft-computing algorithms had better predictive capacity at 72% accuracy versus the 65% of logistic models. Site sizes, population coverage, and air pollution were identified as the main influencers in the potential for site transformation. In Manchester, the likelihood of GI transformation was higher for WWC than derelict sites at 80% versus 60% likelihood, respectively. Furthermore, DS were more likely to transform into grey development based on current trends and urban planning practice. © 2019},

abstract={Patients face difficulties identifying appropriate doctors owing to the sizeable quantity and uneven quality of information in online healthcare communities. In studying physician searches, researchers often focus on expertise similarity matches and sentiment analyses of reviews. However, the quality is often ignored. To address patients’ information needs holistically, we propose a four-dimensional IT framework based on signaling theory. The model takes expertise knowledge, online reviews, profile descriptions (e.g., hospital reputation, number of patients, city) and service quality (e.g., response speed, interaction frequency, cost) as signals that distinguish high-quality physicians. It uses machine learning approaches to derive similarity matches and sentiment analysis. It also measures the relative importance of the signals by multi-criterion analysis and derives the physician rankings through the aggregated scores. Our study revealed that the proposed approach performs better compared with the other two recommend techniques. This research expands the boundary of signaling theory to healthcare management and enriches the literature on IT use and inter-organizational systems. The proposed IT model may improve patient care, alleviate the physician-patient relationship and reduce lawsuits against hospitals; it also has practical implications for healthcare management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We formulate and solve a real-world shape design optimization problem of an air intake ventilation system in a tractor cabin by using a preference-based surrogate-assisted evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm. We are motivated by practical applicability and focus on two main challenges faced by practitioners in industry: 1) meaningful formulation of the optimization problem reflecting the needs of a decision maker and 2) finding a desirable solution based on a decision maker's preferences when solving a problem with computationally expensive function evaluations. For the first challenge, we describe the procedure of modelling a component in the air intake ventilation system with commercial simulation tools. The problem to be solved involves time consuming computational fluid dynamics simulations. Therefore, for the second challenge, we extend a recently proposed Kriging-assisted evolutionary algorithm K-RVEA to incorporate a decision maker's preferences. Our numerical results indicate efficiency in using the computing resources available and the solutions obtained reflect the decision maker's preferences well. Actually, two of the solutions dominate the baseline design (the design provided by the decision maker before the optimization process). The decision maker was satisfied with the results and eventually selected one as the final solution. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

The aim of this research is to use the multi-criteria ratings provided by the travellers in social media networking sites for developing a new recommender system for hotel recommendations in e-tourism platforms. We extend the crisp-based multi-criteria algorithms to fuzzy-based multi-criteria algorithms for finding the similarities between the travellers based on their provided ratings. To develop the recommendation method, we use clustering and prediction machine learning techniques. We evaluate the recommendation system on TripAdvisor data.

The model seeks to maximize the measured 3D visibility in generated units–an attribute associated with low perceived density, recognized as having a positive effect on the well-being of dwellers. Simultaneously, the model engages a learning process, through which the classification of the suitability of each apartment is refined through ‘the wisdom of the crowd’, collected through an open web-simulation. This automated design model, regarding both perceptual and physical needs, demonstrates its potential for future use in the development of larger-scale densified urban environments. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Aerial target threat assessment is an important but stressful task carried out by operators. The work involves determining the threat of aerial targets based on various types of information about the target, such as kinematics, specifications, intelligence reports, and others. The success of threat assessment lies in the reliable fusion of this information. The recent progress in technology allows for the development of more complex decision making methodologies to take into account all types of information, latency, environments, changes in priority, and inconsistencies in the quality and availability of data sources. It also allows for the integration between different decision making methodologies in order to take advantage of the strengths of each independent methodology for different applications. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods provide a structured and intuitive framework for incorporating all available target information to evaluate the target threat. However, threat assessment is a complex process where there is not one MCDM method that works in all situations. The objective of this work is to develop a robust system that uses various MCDM methods as an ensemble (i.e. an EMCDM technique) and machine learning techniques to assess the threat of aerial targets. Experiments involving threat assessment on simulated targets indicate the benefit of using EMCDM techniques instead of using individual MCDM methods for performing high-level information fusion to assign threat values. © 2019 ISIF-International Society of Information Fusion.},

abstract={Various ophthalmic procedures critically depend on high-quality images. For instance, efficiency of teleophthalmology, a framework to bring advanced eye care to remote regions, is determined by the capability of assessing diagnostic quality of ocular fundus photographs (FPs), and rejecting poor-quality ones at the source. In this context, we study algorithmic methods of classifying high-and low-quality FPs. Crucially, diagnostic quality (DQ) -determined by clinically, but not necessarily perceptually, significant structures -is not synonymous with perceptual appeal. Yet, traditional methods handpick features individually (or in small subsets) to meet certain ad hoc perceptual requirements. In contrast, we investigate the efficacy of a comprehensive set of structure-preserving features, systematically generated by a deep scattering network (ScatNet). Specifically, we consider three advanced machine learning classifiers, train each using ScatNet as well as traditional features separately, and demonstrate that the former ensure significantly superior performance for each classifier under multiple criteria including classification accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.},

Therefore, the aim of the work was to create three multicriteria models for the prediction and simulation of winter wheat yield, which were made on the basis of extended quantitative and qualitative variables from field research in the year period 2008-2015. Neural networks with MLP (multi-layer perceptron) topology were used to build the following models, which can predict and simulate the yield on three dates: 15 April, 31 May, and 30 June. For this reason, they were designated as follows: QQWW15_4, QQWW31_5, and QQWW30_6. Each model is based on a different number of independent features, which ranges from 19 to 25. As a result of the conducted analyses, a MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) forecast error from 6.63% to 6.92% was achieved. This is equivalent of an error ranging from 0.521 to 0.547 t·ha-1, with an average yield of 6.57 ton per hectare of cultivated area. In addition, the most important quantitative and qualitative factors influencing the yield were also indicated. In the first predictive range (15 April), it is the average air temperature from 1 September to 31 December of the previous year (T9-12_PY). In the second predictive range (31 May) it is the sum of precipitation from 1 May to 31 May, and in the third (30 June) is the average air temperature from 1 January to 15 April of the year (T1-4_CY). In addition, one of the qualitative factors had a significant impact on the yield in the first phase-the type of forecrop in the previous year (TF_PY). The presented neural modeling method is a specific extension of the previously used predicting methods. An element of innovation of the presented concept of yield modeling is the possibility of performing a simulation before harvest, in the current agrotechnical season. The presented models can be used in large-area agriculture, especially in precision agriculture as an important element of decision-making support systems. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Agricultural land suitability analysis (ALSA) for crop production is one of the key tools for ensuring sustainable agriculture and for attaining the current global food security goal in line with the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations. Although some review studies addressed land suitability, few of them specifically focused on land suitability analysis for agriculture. Furthermore, previous reviews have not reflected on the impact of climate change on future land suitability and how this can be addressed or integrated into ALSA methods. In the context of global environmental changes and sustainable agriculture debate, we showed from the current review that ALSA is a worldwide land use planning approach. We reported from the reviewed articles 69 frequently used factors in ALSA. These factors were further categorized in climatic conditions (16), nutrients and favorable soils (34 of soil and landscape), water availability in the root zone (8 for hydrology and irrigation) and socio-economic and technical requirements (11). Also, in getting a complete view of crop's ecosystems and factors that can explain and improve yield, inherent local socio-economic factors should be considered. We showed that this aspect has been often omitted in most of the ALSA modeling with only 38% of the total reviewed article using socio-economic factors. Also, only 30% of the studies included uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in their modeling process. We found limited inclusions of climate change in the application of the ALSA. We emphasize that incorporating current and future climate change projections in ALSA is the way forward for sustainable or optimum agriculture and food security. To this end, qualitative and quantitative approaches must be integrated into a unique ALSA system (Hybrid Land Evaluation System - HLES) to improve the land evaluation approach. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the recent era, multi-criteria decision making under uncertainty is gaining importance due to its wide range of applicability. Among several types of uncertainty handling techniques, Robust Optimization (RO) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has accessibility to data in uncertain regions. However, solutions of RO may actually deviate from actual results in real scenarios, due to conservative sampling. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate unsupervised machine learning algorithms with RO which thereby makes it data-driven. A novel evolutionary fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to transcript the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enables intelligent Sobol based sampling in these regions for use in RO. Results of two test cases with varying dimensions are presented along with a comprehensive comparison between conventional RO approach using box uncertainty set and proposed methodology. Considered case studies include highly nonlinear real life model for continuous casting from steelmaking industries, where a time expensive multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty is formulated to resolve the conflict in productivity and energy consumption. Optimal Artificial Neural Network (ANN) surrogate assisted optimization under uncertainty for casting model is performed to obtain solutions in realistic time. The resulting RO problem being multi-objective in nature, the Pareto solutions are obtained by NSGA II. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Floods around the world are having devastating effects on human life and property. In this paper, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis techniques (VIKOR, TOPSIS and SAW), along with two machine learning methods (NBT and NB), were tested for their ability to model flood susceptibility in one of China's most flood-prone areas, the Ningdu Catchment. Twelve flood conditioning factors were used as input parameters: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), lithology, land use, distance from river, curvature, altitude, Stream Transport Index (STI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), soil type, slope and rainfall. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated and validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). While all models showed a strong flood prediction capability (AUC > 0.95), the NBT model performed best (AUC = 0.98), suggesting that, among the models studied, the NBT model is a promising tool for the assessment of flood-prone areas and can allow for proper planning and management of flood hazards. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper, an elitist nondominated sorting hybrid algorithm, namely ENSHA, is proposed to solve the multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problem (MOFJSSP) with sequence-dependent setup times/costs (MOFJSSP_SDST/C). The objectives to be minimized are the maximal completion time (i.e., makespan) and the total setup costs (TSC). The makespan is an efficiency-focused objective whereas the TSC is an economic focused one. Existing works mainly consider the efficiency-focused multiple criteria. The main highlights of this paper are threefold, i.e., the operation-based sequence model, the problem-dependent job assignment rules and the novel evolutionary framework of ENSHA. For the operation-based sequence model, this is the first time that the sequence model of MOFJSSPs has been proposed and the TSC has been treated as an independent objective in MOFJSSPs. For the job assignment rules, the solution representation is first proposed, and then three job assignment rules are specifically designed to decode solutions or sequences into feasible scheduling schemes. For the novel evolutionary framework, it works with two populations, i.e., the main population (MP) and the auxiliary population (AP). First, ENSHA adopts the elitist nondominated sorting method for evolving MP to maintain high-quality solutions regarding both the convergence and diversity. Next, a machine learning strategy based on the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is proposed to learn the valuable information from nondominated solutions in MP for building a probabilistic model. This model is then used to generate the offspring of AP. Furthermore, a simple yet effective cooperation-based refinement mechanism is raised to combine MP and AP, so as to generate MP of the next generation. Finally, experimental results on 39 benchmark instances and a real-life case study demonstrate the effectiveness and application values of the proposed ENSHA. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={As a robust and heuristic technique in machine learning, active learning has been established as an effective method for addressing large volumes of unlabeled data; it interactively queries users (or certain information sources) to obtain desired outputs at new data points. With regard to deep learning techniques (e.g., CNN) and their applications (e.g., image classification), labeling work is of great significance as training processes for obtaining parameters in neural networks which requires abundant labeled samples. Although a few active learning algorithms have been proposed for devising certain straightforward sampling strategies (e.g., density, similarity, uncertainty, and label-based measure) for deep learning algorithms, these employ onefold sampling strategies and do not consider the relationship among multiple sampling strategies. To this end, we devised a novel solution “multi-criteria active leep learning”(MCADL) to learn an active learning strategy for deep neural networks in image classification. Our sample selection strategy selects informative samples by considering multiple criteria simultaneously (i.e., density, similarity, uncertainty, and label-based measure). Moreover, our approach is capable of adjusting weights adaptively to fuse the results from multiple criteria effectively by exploring the utilities of the criteria at different training stages. Through extensive experiments on two popular image datasets (i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10), we demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms highly competitive active learning approaches; thereby, it can be verified that our multi-criteria active learning proposal is rational and our solution is effective. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Multi-criteria decision making under uncertainty is a common practice followed in industries and academia. Among several types of uncertainty handling techniques, Chance Constrained Programming (CCP) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has accessibility to distribution of the data for uncertain parameters. However, the assumption that the uncertain parameters must follow some well-behaved probability distribution is a myth for most of the practical applications. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate machine learning algorithms with CCP and thereby make it data-driven. A novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to transcript the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enable intelligent Sobol based sampling in these regions for use in CCP. The Fuzzy clustering mechanism used in the proposed method transforms the existing fuzzy C-means technique such that the decision variables are significantly reduced. This enables evolutionary optimizers to obtain better approximations of the uncertain space by identifying the true clusters. A highly nonlinear real life model for continuous casting from steelmaking industries is considered as a case study for testing the efficiency of data based CCP along with a comprehensive comparison between conventional CCP approach using box uncertainty set and proposed methodology. As the resulting CCP problem is multi-objective in nature, the Pareto solutions are obtained by NSGA II. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present an algorithm designed to train a multi-criteria decision system. This kind of system is very important and used a lot in different military fields and, particularly in cyber-defense. We developed this algorithm to be used with different multi-agent detection systems. The MASFAD system is a typical example [1]. It is a multi-agent system for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection. In this paper we compare different optimization methods for learning Weighted Ordered Weighted Averaging (WOWA) coefficients in order to perform a binary classification. The WOWA function is an aggregation function that is a generalization of OrderedWeighted Averaging (OWA) and the Weighted mean. The WOWA operator combines both of their advantages The learning part is based on a Genetic Algorithm and uses a training dataset. We perform a complete parameter study and we determine the efficiency of our model by evaluating the performance during the classification of different PHP files as webshells or normal files. These PHP files were previously analyzed by a program developed at the Royal Military Academy. We obtain very accurate results and a good stability during the decision process.

abstract={Wind energy is attracting increasing attention with its sustainability and cleanliness. However, owing to the volatility and intermittency of wind speed, it is challenging to establish a scientific and reliable forecasting system. Most research has mainly been based on simple data preprocessing, single objective optimization, and point prediction, which may lead to poor forecasting performance. Hence, in this study, an innovative wind speed forecasting system is developed that incorporates effective data preprocessing and a novel algorithm. In order to alleviate the complexity and chaos of a wind speed series, a fuzzy data preprocessing scheme is designed based on “decomposition and ensemble” and a fuzzy time series. Following this, a multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOICA) is proposed and applied for optimizing an extreme learning machine (ELM), and a corresponding hybrid predictor MOICA-ELM is conducted for wind speed forecasting. For further investigation the uncertainty of wind speed, both point and interval forecasting are employed in this system. Simulation results on four wind speed datasets collected from two wind farms in China are in good accordance with the empirical data with multiple criterion and scientific evaluation; these results and show a good performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and stability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The choice of the most promising algorithm to model and predict a particular phenomenon is one of the most prominent activities of the temporal data forecasting. Forecasting (or prediction), similarly to other data mining tasks, uses empirical evidence to select the most suitable model for a problem at hand since no modeling method can be considered as the best. However, according to our systematic literature review of the last decade, few scientific publications rigorously expose the benefits and limitations of the most popular algorithms for time series prediction. At the same time, there is a limited performance record of these models when applied to complex and highly nonlinear data. In this paper, we present one of the most extensive, impartial and comprehensible experimental evaluations ever done in the time series prediction field. From 95 datasets, we evaluate eleven predictors, seven parametric and four non-parametric, employing two multi-step-ahead projection strategies and four performance evaluation measures. We report many lessons learned and recommendations concerning the advantages, drawbacks, and the best conditions for the use of each model. The results show that SARIMA is the only statistical method able to outperform, but without a statistical difference, the following machine learning algorithms: ANN, SVM, and kNN-TSPI. However, such forecasting accuracy comes at the expense of a larger number of parameters. The evaluated datasets, as well detailed results achieved by different indexes as MSE, Theil's U coefficient, POCID, and a recently-proposed multi-criteria performance measure are available online in our repository. Such repository is another contribution of this paper since other researchers can replicate our results and evaluate their methods more rigorously. The findings of this study will impact further research on this topic since they provide a broad insight into models selection, parameters setting, evaluation measures, and experimental setup. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Evolutionary algorithms are widely used for solving multiobjective optimization problems but are often criticized because of a large number of function evaluations needed. Approximations, especially function approximations, also referred to as surrogates or metamodels are commonly used in the literature to reduce the computation time. This paper presents a survey of 45 different recent algorithms proposed in the literature between 2008 and 2016 to handle computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems. Several algorithms are discussed based on what kind of an approximation such as problem, function or fitness approximation they use. Most emphasis is given to function approximation-based algorithms. We also compare these algorithms based on different criteria such as metamodeling technique and evolutionary algorithm used, type and dimensions of the problem solved, handling constraints, training time and the type of evolution control. Furthermore, we identify and discuss some promising elements and major issues among algorithms in the literature related to using an approximation and numerical settings used. In addition, we discuss selecting an algorithm to solve a given computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problem based on the dimensions in both objective and decision spaces and the computation budget available. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={As being one of the most popular applications in the last decade, dynamic adaptive video streaming applications are used by Internet users every day. In such applications, the underlying architecture allows users to change quality adaptively as their request. The purpose of quality or rate adaptation algorithm is to achieve highest QoE possible. In this paper, we propose a rate adaptation algorithm which allows to increase the quality of already buffered video by using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method. Increasing the quality of the buffered video can be beneficial in areas from resiliency to entertainment. We propose to utilize SDN for deciding weights of MCDM method. For this purpose, SDN controller runs a machine learning algorithm by using its knowledge about current network conditions as an input of the learning algorithm. Simulation results show that users achieve higher QoE by using our approach when compared to conventional rate adaptation algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={We describe a method for queue wait time prediction in supercomputing clusters. It was designed for use as a part of multi-criteria brokering mechanisms for resource selection in a multi-site High Performance Computing environment. The aim is to incorporate the time jobs stay queued in the scheduling system into the selection criteria. Our method can also be used by the end users to estimate the time to completion of their computing jobs. It uses historical data about the particular system to make predictions. It returns a list of probability estimates of the form (t i , p i ), where p i is the probability that the job will start before time t i . Times t i can be chosen more or less freely when deploying the system. Compared to regression methods that only return a single number as a queue wait time estimate (usually without error bars) our prediction system provides more useful information. The probability estimates are calculated using the Bayes theorem with the naive assumption that the attributes describing the jobs are independent. They are further calibrated to make sure they are as accurate as possible, given available data. We describe our service and its REST API and the underlying methods in detail and provide empirical evidence in support of the method’s efficacy.

abstract={Active learning is one of the hotspots in the field of machine learning. The most crucial problem lies in the design of an appropriate valued criterion for selecting the most valuable unlabeled sample. Traditional active learning does not consider the fuzziness in the framework of active learning, which could significantly limit their performance. In this paper, an active learning method based on fuzzy set theory (FT-AL) is proposed to solve this problem. First, multi-criteria are established, which aim at the fuzziness in the framework of active learning. Second, weight factors are introduced into the multi-criteria. Finally, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is established, which could evaluate the effect of the samples to be labeled. The experimental results show that the proposed methods have positive effects on improving the effect of base classifiers. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The crucial role of customers’ positive experience and their subsequent word-of-mouth have been highlighted by both scholars and practitioners for all industry sectors. In response to an increasing concern of environmental sustainability and sensitivity of consumers for deteriorating environment, eco-friendly (green) products and services gained tremendous attention. TripAdvisor is increasingly known as one of the most popular e-tourism platforms. Understanding and predicting the traveler’ preferences by advanced big data analytics technology is an important task that the recommendation engine of this platform does. In this paper, we aim to develop a new soft computing method with the aid of machine learning techniques in order to find the best matching eco-friendly hotels based on the several quality factors in TripAdvisor. We develop the method using dimensionality reduction and prediction machine learning techniques to improve the scalability of prediction from the large number of users’ ratings. The proposed soft computing method is evaluated on a large dataset discovered from the TripAdvisor platform. The results show that the combination of dimensionality reduction and prediction machine learning techniques is robust in processing the large number of the ratings provided by users on the features of eco-friendly hotels and predicting travelers’ choice preferences of eco-friendly hotels in TripAdvisor. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this research, a novel aluminum alloy and metal matrix composite was designed and developed for self healing purpose. Tin at varying weight percentages (5, 10, 15 & 20 wt%) was alloyed into aluminum along with other alloying elements to form a new set of metal alloy and 5 wt% of SiC particles was dispersed to the above said combinations to develop new sets of composite materials. Optical microscope of the developed set of samples reveals a modification in the grain structure with dispersion of tin element and with respect to increment of tin content the hardness value tends to decrease. Investigated the effect of wire electric discharge machining (WEDM) process parameters such as Pulse On time (PON), Pulse Off time (POFF), wire feed rate (WFR) along with the material elemental composition parameters Sn wt% and SiC wt% using Taguchi coupled Grey Relational Analysis. On behalf of the above said parameters a L32 orthogonal array based experimental design was finalized and based on the experimental studies single and multi criteria based optimization was conceded. Significance of each processing parameters over the output responses Material Removal Rate (MRR) and surface roughness (Ra) was examined through ANOVA method. Machine learning techniques was used and Neural Network models was developed to predict the MRR and Ra values and the experimental confirmations identified the effectiveness of the developed models. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Due to the increased number of applications of both microscopic imaging and image analysis including biomedical studies, the design of specialized algorithms and tools to facilitate quantitative assessment of objects in the image content is of urgent need. Recently, a number of approaches ranging from object counting by machine learning methods to statistical image analysis have been suggested and successfully implemented to resolve the cell quantification problem. Here, we revisit the above problem considering samples where objects presented in the same images have to be explicitly distinguished and quantified without involving any dedicated experimental setting like differential fluorescent staining. We consider several possible classification criteria and show explicitly how their combination in a single algorithm can be used to improve results in complex images where single criteria-based rules inevitably fail. Finally, we suggest a possible approach for the analysis of non-homogeneous images based on combining object selection results for different threshold values thus enhancing the algorithm from multi-criteria to multi-threshold analysis. To demonstrate the performance of the suggested solutions, we show several prominent examples of complex structures ranging from images containing both live and apoptotic cells as well as containing mixtures of globular and fibrous forms of heat-shock protein IbpA. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The aim of this research is to investigate multi-criteria decision making [spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE)], bivariate statistical methods [frequency ratio (FR), index of entropy (IOE), weighted linear combination (WLC)] and machine learning [support vector machine (SVM)] models for estimating landslide susceptibility at the Wuning area, China. A total of 445 landslides were randomly classified into 70% (311 landslides) and 30% (134 landslides) to train and validate landslide models, respectively. Fourteen landslide conditioning factors including slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, topographic wetness index, stream power index, sediment transport index, soil, lithology, NDVI, land use, rainfall, distance to road, distance to river and distance to fault were then studied for landslide susceptibility assessment. Performances of five studied models were evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for training (success rate curve) and validation (prediction rate curve) datasets, statistical-based measures and tests. Results indicated that the area under the success rate curve for the FR, IOE, WLC, SVM and SMCE models was 88.32%, 82.58%, 78.91%, 85.47% and 89.96%, respectively, demonstrating that SMCE could provide the higher accuracy. The prediction capability findings revealed that the SMCE model (AUC = 86.81%) was also the highest approach among the five studied models, followed by the FR (AUC = 84.53%), the SVM (AUC = 81.24%), the IOE (AUC = 79.67%) and WLC (73.92%) methods. The landslide susceptibility maps derived from the above five models are reasonably accurate and could be used to perform elementary land use planning for hazard extenuation. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={A new evolutionary-learning algorithm is proposed to learn a decision maker (DM)'s best solution on a conflicting multiobjective space. Given the exemplary pairwise comparisons of solutions by a DM, we learn an ideal point (for the DM) that is used to evolve toward a better set of solutions. The process is repeated to get the DM's best solution. The comparison of solutions in pairs facilitates the process of eliciting training information for the proposed learning model. Experimental study on standard multiobjective data sets shows that the proposed method accurately identifies a DM's preferred zone in relatively a few generations and with a small number of preferences. Besides, it is found to be robust to inconsistencies in the preference statements. The results obtained are validated through a variant of the established NSGA-2 algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The security inside the network correspondence is a noteworthy concern. Being the way that information is considered as the profitable asset of an association, giving security against the intruders is exceptionally fundamental. Intrusion Detection Systems tries to recognize security assaults of intruders by researching a few information records saw in forms on the network. In this paper, Intrusion Detection Classification of attacks is done by NNIDS, TSVID and DF-IDS. The proposed algorithms are trained and tested using KDD Cup 1999 dataset. This paper has presented a novel method for an adaptive fault tolerant mobile agent based intrusion detection system. At first the classification of attacks is done by TSVID Classification algorithm. The TSVID makes use of RBF kernel and iterative learning mechanism. Next the classification is done by using NNIDS that makes use of neural network based approach. Advantages of NNIDS method is that it can successfully handle both qualitative, quantitative data, and it handles multiple criteria and easier to understand. Then, finally, the classification is done by using iterative learning mechanism and DF-IDS gives successful results of classification. The performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated using the classification metrics such as detection rate and accuracy. Comparison graphs of attack detection rate and false-alarm rate reveals that the obtained results of anticipated methods achieve greater detection rate and less computational time for the classification of attacks and protocols. The proposed study is a classification based approach for combining several networks in intrusion detection systems. In evaluation of this model, it has been demonstrated that there is a significant improvement in real time performance without sacrificing efficiency. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Pipelines are the most important way to transport large amounts of dangerous substances as oil and gas, through long distances, due to their advantages in terms of safety and low cost. However, failures and leaks in pipelines may happen and sometimes they generate catastrophic consequences. In this paper we propose an approach for the risk assessment of oil and gas pipeline defects leveraging machines learning algorithms and multi-criteria decision methods (MCDM), with the objective of accompanying decision-makers for prioritizing risk mitigation activities. The pipeline defects risk assessment approach proposed is based on some machines learning algorithms, which allows to cluster ILI (In Line Inspection) data performed by smart pigs in a group of clusters by using K-means method, then, two classifications methods (decision trees and neural network) are applied on clusters in order to construct a classification model of defects risk on pipe in three level (High, Medium and Low) according to theirs criticizes. The discovered models are assessed using cross validation, which allows choosing a model based on a decision tree as a pipeline defects risk classification and prediction model. For scheduling maintenance and reparation operations we apply the multi-criteria decision method AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) in order to rank-order defects which belong to the High class according to theirs criticizes degree. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={An early intervention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is highly essential due to the fact that this neuro degenerative disease generates major life-threatening issues, especially memory loss among patients in society. Moreover, categorizing NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and AD early in course allows the patients to experience benefits from new treatments. Therefore, it is important to construct a reliable classification technique to discriminate the patients with or without AD from the bio medical imaging modality. Hence, we developed a novel FCM based Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network (FWPNN) classification algorithm and analyzed the brain images related to structural MRI modality for better discrimination of class labels. Initially our proposed framework begins with brain image normalization stage. In this stage, ROI regions related to Hippo-Campus (HC) and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from the brain images are extracted using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. Subsequently, nineteen highly relevant AD related features are selected through Multiple-criterion feature selection method. At last, our novel FWPNN classification algorithm is imposed to remove suspicious samples from the training data with an end goal to enhance the classification performance. This newly developed classification algorithm combines both the goodness of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The experimental validation is carried out with the ADNI subset and then to the Bordex-3 city dataset. Our proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of about 98.63%, 95.4%, 96.4% in terms of classification with AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI. The experimental results suggest that the removal of noisy samples from the training data can enhance the decision generation process of the expert systems. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In the recent years, various statistical and computational intelligence or machine learning techniques have contributed to the progress of automation or semiautomation for measuring consumer credit scoring in the banking sector. However, most of the Taiwanese commercial banks still rely on seasoned staffs’ judgments on making the final approvals or rejections. To enhance the understanding and transparency of a decision support system (or model) that can assist bank staffs on making their consumer credit loan decisions—while uncertainty exist—is of high business value. One of the promising approaches is multiple rule-based decision-making (MRDM), a subfield of the hybrid multiple criteria decision-making that leverages the advantages of machine learning, soft computing, and decision methods (or techniques). The MRDM approach reveals comprehensible logics (rules or patterns) that can be justified and compared with the existing knowledge of veterans to reinforce the confidence of their judgments. Therefore, in the present study, we propose and compare two MRDM approaches in assisting decision makers on the consumer credit loan evaluations. A set of historical data from a commercial bank in Taiwan is analyzed for illustrating the plausible pros and cons of the two approaches with discussions. © 2018, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Many regions in arid and semi-arid lands suffer from water resource scarcity due to climatic constraints combined with a rapid increase in domestic water consumption due to population and industry growth. The increased demand for high-quality and sustainable water assets creates an urgent need to investigate groundwater resources as an alternative solution. In this study, weighted overlay analysis based on an analytical hierarchy process and supported by a random forest machine learning technique was utilized to explore groundwater potential zones in the northern United Arab Emirates (UAE). Toward that end, eight thematic layers were prepared and processed in a geographic information science environment to produce the groundwater potential map (GPM): elevation, slope, precipitation, geology, geomorphology, drainage stream density, major fracture, and lineament density. The resultant GPM was classified in five potential groundwater zones ranging from very high to very low. The GPM was validated based on existing well distribution and selected wellfield yielding production. It was found that 81.7% of existing wells are located in the moderate-high zone and higher. Single-parameter sensitivity analysis technique revealed that the geology, precipitation, and geomorphology were the most significant factors, with a mean effective weight of 42.7%, 34.22%, and 32.23%, respectively. This research provides substantial insights for local water managers and authorities by providing a GPM as well as geo-hydrological findings in order to achieve sustainable groundwater management in the UAE. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The effectiveness of machine learning algorithms depends on the quality of the supplied training data. Any problems embedded in the nature of data will result in obtaining incorrect classification models, especially imbalanced data distribution is among the most significant learning difficulties that can affect classifiers. As one of the classes has much more instances than the other, the learning process becomes biased towards it. Therefore, methods for alleviating the impact of skewed distributions are highly sought after. Ensemble learning has emerged as one of the leading paradigms for imbalanced data. Creation of an efficient pool of classifiers is not a trivial task and one needs to carefully select which classifiers should be combined to obtain the best predictive power. In this paper, we propose a compound ensemble pruning algorithm for imbalanced data. It aims to retain classifiers that offer the best performance on both minority and majority classes, and display a high level of diversity. Remaining learners are discarded from the pool. This is achieved by the means of a multi-criteria evolutionary algorithm. Extensive experimental study show that our proposal is able to create smaller ensembles than the state-of-the-art methods, while offering an improved robustness to imbalanced class distributions. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Multi-criteria inventory classification groups inventory items into classes, each of which is managed by a specific re-order policy according to its priority. However, the tasks of inventory classification and control are not carried out jointly if the classification criteria and the classification approach are not robustly established from an inventory-cost perspective. Exhaustive simulations at the single item level of the inventory system would directly solve this issue by searching for the best re-order policy per item, thus achieving the subsequent optimal classification without resorting to any multi-criteria classification method. However, this would be very time-consuming in real settings, where a large number of items need to be managed simultaneously. In this article, a reduction in simulation effort is achieved by extracting from the population of items a sample on which to perform an exhaustive search of best re-order policies per item; the lowest cost classification of in-sample items is, therefore, achieved. Then, in line with the increasing need for ICT tools in the production management of Industry 4.0 systems, supervised classifiers from the machine learning research field (i.e. support vector machines with a Gaussian kernel and deep neural networks) are trained on these in-sample items to learn to classify the out-of-sample items solely based on the values they show on the features (i.e. classification criteria). The inventory system adopted here is suitable for intermittent demands, but it may also suit non-intermittent demands, thus providing great flexibility. The experimental analysis of two large datasets showed an excellent accuracy, which suggests that machine learning classifiers could be implemented in advanced inventory classification systems. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Conventional cartography practices situate a cartographer in a computer environment in which choices are made about a limited number of map characteristics. A map is then produced using these choices. Such maps are often judged inadequate and an alternative will be generated, typically by changing a parameter value. This does not always lead to a satisfactory outcome, particularly when, as is increasingly common, novices are involved in mapmaking. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a paradigm change in statistical cartography, one in which the production of maps switches from a sequence of actions taken by a mapmaker to a process of specifying criteria that are used to create maps using intelligent agents. A solution is then selected that satisfices the elicited criteria and others derived from cartographic theory and praxis. The cartographer’s role in this paradigm shifts from involvement in a sequence of low-level software-mediated tasks to a higher level. This active symbolism approach is described and then illustrated using the production of dot maps to illustrate how collections of intelligent design agents are used to generate emergent alternatives that can be evaluated against design criteria and how deep learning can be introduced as part of the design process. © 2018, © 2018 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.},

abstract={The development of credit risk assessment models in the context of credit scoring and rating, is a data-intensive task that involves a considerable level of sophistication in terms of data preparation, analysis, and modeling. From a data analytics perspective, the construction of credit scoring and rating models can be considered as a classification task, that requires the development of models differentiating the borrowers by their level of credit risk. The model fitting process can be implemented with various methodological approaches, based on different types of models, model fitting criteria, and estimation procedures. This chapter presents an overview of different analytical modeling techniques from various fields, such as statistical models (naïve Bayes classifier, discriminant analysis, logistic regression), machine learning (classification trees, neural networks, ensembles), and multicriteria decision aid (value function models and outranking models). Moreover, performance measurement issues are discussed, focusing on the presentation of various popular metrics for evaluating the predictive power and information value of credit scoring and rating models. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This chapter illustrates the application of analytical predictive and descriptive techniques for credit risk assessment. To this end, two case applications are presented using data sets involving corporate defaults and credit card loans. The first part is devoted to the prediction of corporate defaults. A data set of 13,414 European small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) from six countries is considered during the period 2009–2011. The information available for the firms involves their financial characteristics. Corporate default prediction models are constructed with statistical, machine learning, and multicriteria decision making techniques. The analysis of the results covers both the predictive performance of the models, as well as the insights that they provide regarding the factors that affect the default risk for European SMEs. In the second part, a descriptive multivariate clustering approach is employed to obtain analyze credit card loan applications. A publicly available data set of 30,000 cases is analyzed with the k-medoids algorithm to identify clusters of borrowers having similar characteristics. The results are discussed in terms of the common features of the clusters and their level of credit risk. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The paper deals with the reconstruction of implicitly defined functions or digital images. Functions are defined using observations, each of which is the result of a pairwise comparison of the function values for two random arguments. The analysis of the current state of research for particular statements of this problem is presented: the method of pairwise comparisons used in decision-making for a finite set of alternatives; reconstruction of preference/utility function in multicriteria tasks; sign representations of images used for the description and analysis of digital images. A unified approach to reconstructing functions and images according to their sign representations is proposed, based on mapping in a high-dimensional space and constructing a linear (when reconstructing a function and images) or non-linear (including non-parametric) classifier (when reconstructing preferences). For a number of classification algorithms, experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the example of the reconstruction of the utility function in problems of decision theory and reconstruction of the brightness function of real images. © 2019, Institution of Russian Academy of Sciences.

abstract={The oil & gas industry is catching up to automation of traditional workflows practiced in the industry and implementation of artificial intelligence to fasten repetitive tasks. This is driven by the need to automate low-cognitive tasks enabling engineers to spend more time on high-cognitive components of the existing workflows, thus leading up to smarter decisions. This has been made possible by the recent developments and adoption of various analytics and machine learning tools. Well intervention and workover are a routine and important exercise undertaken in the oil and gas industry where the objective is to identify the sick wells and diagnose the right intervention and workover to improve the production. A typical well intervention and workover candidates study includes: 1. Identifying the underperforming wells, 2. Diagnosing these wells and identifying the right workover/ intervention opportunities 3. Creating a ranking of the opportunities using a standard approach. 4. Forecasting the gain after workover/intervention 5. Running economic analysis to identify the candidate based on opportunity's profitability Ujung Pangkah Oil and Gas Field is an offshore field located in Indonesia. The reservoir is a multilayered carbonate oil and gas reservoir, being produced mostly through horizontal wells. An intelligent solution termed as SWORDS was developed for the Ujung Pangkah field that enables the engineers to be permanently aware of the intervention and workover opportunities. The SWORDS solution is driven by 'Automation & Analytics', where the ranking of the opportunities has been driven by a multi-criteria decision making process leveraging the Petroleum Engineering techniques practiced over decades.

abstract={Advanced production planning and scheduling approaches increasingly rely on simulation-based optimization methods. This entails the problem of a high computational effort due to complex models, resulting in limitations for the practical application of otherwise powerful methods. While machine-learning methods offer a potential for performance improvement, approaches for real-life applications with a high complexity are still lacking. This paper explores the potential for machine learning, especially artificial neural networks, used as surrogate models, to improve the performance of a recently developed planning method for real life production planning applications. The simulation considered in this paper is a complex hybrid discrete-continuous model, enabling the method to pursue energy efficiency simultaneously with economic goals, in a complex multi-criteria goal system. The artificial neural network is trained via offline learning and is meant to provide a computationally cheap evaluation of intermediate planning solutions, compiled by an optimization algorithm during an optimization run. The approach is developed and evaluated in a case-study on the food industry, indicating a basic feasibility of the approach but also pointing out necessary future challenges to be solved towards practical applicability. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Smartphones play important roles in intelligent transportation systems and driving behavior evaluation contexts. By data mining of smartphone data, the driving style can be recognized efficiently. Then any incentive or punitive mechanisms can be applied to encourage the drivers to perform better. The insurance and police departments can easily use smartphone-based systems to check the driving behaviors gradually. Since, a smartphone consists of many sensors, memory and a high processing power, it can be used as a black-box for storing the driver statue. When an agency needs to understand something about driving or crashing, the smartphone data can be analyzed to clear the situations. However, such data should be collected with low energy consumption. To this aim, the multiple criteria such as precision, frequency, energy consumption, data quality, security and privacy are factors to select a reasonable set of sensors for data collection and data mining. In this problem, the type of communication is also important. For preprocessing of these data, different filters are developed to clean data and remove noise and outliers. For sensors fusion and to model data, some neural networks or other machine learning algorithms can be applied. Then, the data are compressed by some intervals, Fourier transforms, wavelets transforms, statistical distribution, stochastic variables or fuzzy quantities. To extract the knowledge from these data, the necessary features can be extracted from the raw data by the aid of matrix decomposition, PCA, deep learning, etc. Sometimes, it is necessary to reduce the dimension of features by feature selection methods. For processing, based on the needs, we can implement data visualizers, predictors, classifiers, frequent pattern miners or clusters extractors. We discuss on the different concepts of data mining approaches on smartphone data in this chapter. Some applications based on these processed data are developed to warn drivers or pedestrians, to define insurance encouragement, or to provide a background for autonomous driving. © 2019 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={The Republic of Kazakhstan has significant deposits of fossil fuels and is one of the largest energy producers among the countries of Central Asia. At the same time, The Republic of Kazakhstan is one of the richest countries of theworld in terms of renewable resources, evaluated to over 1000 billion kWh/year. The application of therenewable energy sources (RES), both on a large scale and at the level of a single household, ensures the transformation of the energy system to a "green state". However, these initiatives should be substantiated by relevant supportive information to promote transformation of the country's economy to a qualitative ecological state. The paper covers developed multi-criteria decision-making system (MCDM) and software tools for processing of spatial heterogeneous data which could be applied for evaluation of the RES potential. The developed system serves to evaluate the potential of usable RES as it allows the assessment of a territory of the country in terms of installing photovoltaic and wind generators. A feature of the proposed MCDM is the use of an analytical hierarchical process (AHP) in combination with the Bayesian approach, which allows obtaining two complementary assessments of the territory areas. The method allows a rough estimate in an event of lack of data. The verification performed based on the available data on the installed solar and wind power stations shows that the system gives a relatively small root-mean-square error within 15%. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

abstract={The construction industry is responsible for a large share of the global environmental impact. The need for addressing sustainability and increased competition calls for the development of innovative design methods that include sustainability in a transparent way. The aim of this work is to propose a framework to use machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for structural design optimization based on sustainability and buildability criteria. AI opens up new possibilities to optimize and assess structures early in the planning and design stages. In that way, it is possible to decrease the negative and enhance the positive environmental, economic and social impacts and create a more time‐ and cost‐effective design process. The work is meant to serve as a first step toward the development of AI‐based methods in the construction industry, which can bring digitalization in the construction industry to a new level and create new services and business models. © 20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report.

abstract={Scheduling is a decision making process that takes care of the allocation of resources to tasks over time. The Job Shop scheduling problem is one of the most complex scheduling scenarios and is commonly encountered in manufacturing industries. Most of the existing studies are based on optimizing one objective, but in real-world problems, multiple criteria often need to be optimized at once. We propose a Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithm that aims to obtain the non-dominated solutions set for Job Shop scheduling problems. The proposed algorithm is used to solve a set of benchmark problems optimizing makespan and tardiness. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated and compared to other algorithms from the literature using two measures for evaluating the Pareto front. We show that our algorithm is able to find a set of diverse and high quality non-dominated solutions, that significantly and consistently improves upon the results obtained by other state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Treatment planning is an essential step of the radiotherapy workflow. It has become more sophisticated over the past couple of decades with the help of computer science, enabling planners to design highly complex radiotherapy plans to minimize the normal tissue damage while persevering sufficient tumor control. As a result, treatment planning has become more labor intensive, requiring hours or even days of planner effort to optimize an individual patient case in a trial-and-error fashion. More recently, artificial intelligence has been utilized to automate and improve various aspects of medical science. For radiotherapy treatment planning, many algorithms have been developed to better support planners. These algorithms focus on automating the planning process and/or optimizing dosimetric trade-offs, and they have already made great impact on improving treatment planning efficiency and plan quality consistency. In this review, the smart planning tools in current clinical use are summarized in 3 main categories: automated rule implementation and reasoning, modeling of prior knowledge in clinical practice, and multicriteria optimization. Novel artificial intelligence-based treatment planning applications, such as deep learning-based algorithms and emerging research directions, are also reviewed. Finally, the challenges of artificial intelligence-based treatment planning are discussed for future works.},

abstract={Recommender Systems (RSs) are termed as web-based applications that make use of filtering methods and several machine learning algorithms to suggest relevant user objects. It can be said that some techniques are usually adopted or trained to develop these systems that generate lists of suitable recommendations. Conventionally, RS uses a single rating approach to preference user recommendation over an item. Recently, multi-criteria technique has been identified as a new approach of recommending user items based on several attributes or features of user items. This new technique of item recommendation has been adopted to solve several recommendation problems compared to the single rating approach. Furthermore, the predictive performance of the multi-criteria technique when tested proves to be further efficient as compared to the traditional single ratings approach. This paper gives a comparative study between two models that are based on the features and architecture of fuzzy sets system and adaptive genetic algorithm. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are robust and stochastic search techniques centered on natural selection and evaluation that are often applied when encountering optimization problems. Fuzzy logic (FL) on the other hand, is known for its wide application in diverse fields in science. This study aims to evaluate, analyze, and compare the predictive performance of both methods and present their results. The study has been accomplished using Yahoo! Movies dataset, and the results of the performance of each model have been presented in this paper. The results proved that both techniques have significantly enhanced the system's accuracy. © 2019 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy is administered intravenously during the treatment of breast cancer. Prior to surgery, doctors recommend chemotherapy to shrink the large size of an invasive tumor. This research work proposes a Deux Machine Learning framework, implementing a double ensemble of Machine Learning algorithms for building an optimized and efficient solution to predict a complete pathological response of patients after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy. Unlike algorithms which focus on the accuracy of prediction, the performance of the Deux Machine Learning framework is measured using a multi criteria decision-making technique known as weighted simple additive weighting (WSAW). The WSAW comprehensive performance score is calculated by considering ten evaluation metrics, namely, Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, MCC, and ROC. The results are validated using the k-fold cross validation technique, achieving an accuracy of 99.08%. When the performance of the proposed framework is compared with the performance of state-of-the-art classifiers such as SVM and random forest, the results are quite promising. With the growing trend of the applications of Artificial Intelligence in Cancer research, Machine Learning has an important future in prognostication and decision-making. © 2019},

abstract={Bank credit risk assessment is performed by credit rating agencies in order to reduce information asymmetry in financial markets. This costly process has been automated in earlier studies by using systems based on machine learning methods. However, such systems suffer from interpretability issues and do not utilize expert knowledge effectively. To overcome those problems, multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) methods have recently been used to simulate the assessment process performed by the committee of multiple credit risk experts. However, standard MCGDM methods fail to consider high uncertainty inherently associated with the assessment and do not work effectively when the assessed credit risk criteria interact with each other. To address these issues, we propose MCGDM model for bank credit risk assessment that has two advantages: (1) The imprecise assessment criteria are represented by interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and (2) the interactions among the criteria are modeled using fuzzy cognitive maps. When combined with traditional TOPSIS approach to ranking alternatives, we show that the proposed model can be effectively applied to assess bank credit risk. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={The defense techniques for machine learning are critical yet challenging due to the number and type of attacks for widely applied machine learning algorithms are significantly increasing. Among these attacks, the poisoning attack, which disturbs machine learning algorithms by injecting poisoning samples, is an attack with the greatest threat. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the characteristics of positioning samples and propose a novel sample evaluation method to defend against the poisoning attack catering for the characteristics of poisoning samples. To capture the intrinsic data characteristics from heterogeneous aspects, we first evaluate training data by multiple criteria, each of which is reformulated from a spectral clustering. Then, we integrate the multiple evaluation scores generated by the multiple criteria through the proposed multiple spectral clustering aggregation (MSCA) method. Finally, we use the unified score as the indicator of poisoning attack samples. Experimental results on intrusion detection data sets show that MSCA significantly outperforms the K-means outlier detection in terms of data legality evaluation and poisoning attack detection.

abstract={Various classifiers have been proposed for financial risk prediction. The traditional practice of using a singular performance metric for classifier evaluation is not sufficient for imbalanced classification. This paper proposes a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)-based approach to evaluate imbalanced classifiers in credit and bankruptcy risk prediction by considering multiple performance metrics simultaneously. An experimental study is designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of imbalanced classifiers using the proposed evaluation approach over seven financial imbalanced data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The TOPSIS, a well-known MCDM method, was applied to rank three categories of imbalanced classifiers using six popular evaluation criteria. The rankings results indicate that: 1) the rankings generated by the TOPSIS, which combine the results of six evaluation criteria, provide a more reasonable evaluation of imbalanced classifiers over any single performance criterion; and 2) Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)-based ensemble techniques outperform other groups of imbalanced learning approaches. Specifically, SMOTEBoost-C4.5, SMOTE-C4.5, and SMOTE-MLP were ranked as the top three classifiers based on their performances on the six criteria. © 2013 IEEE.},

In microblogging, UCG can be generated in the form of ‘newsworthy’ posts, i.e., related to information that has a public utility for the people. In this context, being the UGC diffused without almost any traditional form of trusted external control, the possibility of incurring in possible fake news is far from remote. For this reason, several approaches for fake news detection in microblogging have been proposed up to now, mostly based on machine learning techniques. In this paper, an ongoing work based on the use of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) paradigm to detect fake news is proposed. The aim is to reduce data dependency in building the model, and to have flexible control over the choices behind the fake news detection process. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

We make use of the preference-learning (PL) technique to induce predictive preference models from empirical data. Because PL is emerging as a new subfield of machine learning, we could use standard machine-learning methods to accomplish our learning objective. We consider the DM’s exemplary preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons between alternatives as the training information. The DM’s decision model is captured in terms of (a), (b), and (c), through the parameters of an attitudinal Choquet integral operator. The proposed learning approach is validated through an experimental study on 16 standard data sets. The superiority of the proposed method in terms of predictive accuracy and easier interpretability is shown both theoretically as well as empirically. Copyright: © 2019 INFORMS.},

abstract={In the last few years Parkinson’s Disease (PD) getting lot of attention due to increase in the old age population all over the world. Gait Analysis appeared to be most important tool to study the characteristics of PD. With the advent of low cost wearable sensors as well as powerful machine learning technique lot of researchers finding the method feasible for early detection of PD. Since the collected datasets contains many features, it is necessary to implement the feature selection methods to reduce the computational time as well as to compare the performance of the classifiers with the selected features. In this paper wearable sensors are used for collecting the accelerometer data of 50 patients suffered with Parkinson’s disease inside our University hospital. The datasets were further preprocessed for modelling and then various feature selection algorithm and machine learning techniques are applied to measure the performances such as accuracy, precision and recall, and finally multi criteria decision method named “The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to perform the comparison analysis. This modelling-based approach will help to find the best suitable feature selection techniques as well as provide good accuracy with less possible time. This will help the clinicians to find suitable patterns for early diagnosis of PD. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Over the past few years, multi-label classification has been widely explored in the machine learning community. This resulted in a number of multi-label classification methods requiring benchmarking to determine their strengths and weakness. For these reasons, typically, the authors compare the methods using a set of benchmark problems (datasets) with regard to different performance measures. At the end, the results are discussed for each performance measure separately. In order to give a general conclusion in which the contribution of each performance measure will be included, we propose a performance measures fusion approach based on multi criteria decision analysis. The approach provides rankings of the compared methods for each benchmark problem separately. These rankings can then be aggregated to discover sets of correlated measures as well as sets of evaluation measures that are least correlated. The performance and the robustness of the proposed methodology is investigated and illustrated on the results from a comprehensive experimental study including 12 multi-label classification according to 16 performance measures on a set of 11 benchmark problems.

abstract={Nominal classification (NC) is a subfield of multi-criteria decision making where an object (in a broad sense) characterized by some attributes (with their valuation belonging to an ordered set, numeric in general) must be assigned to one of pre-defined classes or categories; these classes are characterized by some numerical valued features. This is also known as supervised classification as opposed to unsupervised classification in machine learning literature. In many applications such as that of risk analysis, characterization of classes by features may not be precisely defined; they will be rather fuzzily expressed using linguistic appreciation such as high is better, low is more appreciated, medium range is better, etc. leading to what is referred to as fuzzy nominal classification (FNC). On other hand bipolar reasoning is pervasive in classification in the sense that given a couple (feature, class), there will be some values of the feature that lead to automatically assigning (respect. automatically excluding to assign) the considered object into that class leading to what we name bipolar fuzzy nominal classification or BFNC for short; the main purpose of this paper is to develop this BFNC framework with risk analysis as an illustrative application domain. The stepping stones of this framework are two indexes for each couple (class, object) known as classifiability index (that measures the extent to which the considered object can be included into that class) and the rejectability index measuring the extent to which one should avoid including this object into that class. By using two indexes for classification, many classes can be qualified for inclusion of a given object rendering this framework flexible. Analyzing risks for large-scale complex systems requires identifying, assessing, and prioritizing different risk scenarios for their appropriate treatment such as resources allocation for risk mitigation, risk prevention, risk sharing, etc. To this end and given scarcity of resources in general, one must consider first prioritizing, filtering, or scoring risks that return to assigning them to pre-defined classes or categories; that is nominally classifying them. The developed BFNC framework applied to a real world application in the domain of countries' risk classification shows its practical potentialities. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Many crucial applications of wireless sensor networks rely radically on routing protocols for an efficient data delivery. This paper presents a case study of scrutinizing the use-fulness of hybridization of machine learning classifiers in order to develop a Multi-Criteria Topsis based Ensemble (MCTOPE) framework. Technique for Order of preferences by similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a multi-criteria assessment algorithm is employed to optimize the built ensemble learner for the prediction of an optimal reactive routing protocol for a wireless sensor network (WSN). The performance of the framework is first validated using six different machine learning datasets, and then the proposed method is implemented as a web application using R script and Python Django web framework. After experimenting with more than thousand combinations of training samples and ten base classifiers for the routing protocol prediction problem, MCTOPE framework builds an ensemble of support vector machine and neural network classifiers with an accuracy of 99.6%, which is far better, when it is compared with the performance of state-of-the-art classifiers. With the appearance of tremendous growth of machine learning classifiers in plenty of applications, an automatic ensemble building machine learning technique helps in minimizing the risk of obtaining poor results from a single classifier system, and will play a big part for efficient predictions in the future. © 2018 IEEE.},

WRESTORE utilizes the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrologic model for simulating the impact of landscape decisions on watershed processes. The WRESTORE system is one of many systems which interacts with users directly and thus is directly influenced by the quality and quantity of data in user feedback. The user modeling component within the WRESTORE decision support system utilizes neural network approaches, such as deep learning. Working with small data on user modeling is a non-trivial task which is examined in more detail in this study. We believe the originality of our approach centers on integrating user models with limited data in this application-specific interactive design and human-computer collaborative problem-solving approach.

abstract={The current review contributes with an extensive overview of decision support systems in diagnosing heart diseases in clinical settings. The investigators independently screened and abstracted studies related to heart diseases-based clinical decision support system (DSS) published until 8-June-2015 in PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane Library. The data extracted from the twenty full-text articles that met the inclusion criteria was classified under the following fields; heart diseases, methods for data sets formation, machine learning algorithms, machine learning-based DSS, comparator types, outcome evaluation and clinical implications of the reported DSS. Out of total of 331 studies 20 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies relate to ischemic heart diseases with neural network being the most common machine learning (ML) technique. Among the ML techniques, ANN classifies myocardial infarction with 97% and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with 87.5% accuracy, CART classifies heart failure with 87.6%, neural network ensembles classifies heart valve with 97.4%, support vector machine classifies arrhythmia screening with 95.6%, logistic regression classifies acute coronary syndrome with 72%, artificial immune recognition system classifies coronary artery disease with 92.5% and genetic algorithms and multi-criteria decision analysis classifies chest-pain patients with 91% accuracy respectively. There were 55% studies that validated the results in clinical settings while 25% validated the results through experimental setups. Rest of the studies (20%) did not report the applicability and feasibility of their methods in clinical settings. The study categorizes the ML techniques according to their performance in diagnosing various heart diseases. It categorizes, compares and evaluates the comparator based on physician’s performance, gold standards, other ML techniques, different models of same ML technique and studies with no comparison. It also investigates the current, future and no clinical implications. In addition, trends of machine learning techniques and algorithms used in the diagnosis of heart diseases along with the identification of research gaps are reported in this study. The reported results suggest reliable interpretations and detailed graphical self-explanatory representations by DSS. The study reveals the need for establishment of non-ambiguous real-time clinical data for proper training of DSS before it can be used in clinical settings. The future research directions of the ML-based DSS is mostly directed towards development of generalized systems that can decide on clinical measurements which are easily accessible and assessable in real-time. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Recommender systems (RSs) are web-based tools that use various machine learning and filtering methods to propose useful items for users. Several techniques have been used to develop such a system for generating a list of useful recommendations. Traditionally, RSs use a single rating to represent preferences of a user on an item. A multi-criteria recommendation is a new technique that recommends items to users based on multiple attributes of the items. This technique has been used to solve many recommendation problems. Its predictive performance has been tested and proved to be more efficient than the traditional approach. However, this paper presents a model that is based on the architecture and main features of fuzzy sets and systems. Fuzzy logic (FL) is widely known for its application in different fields of study with its main advantage being that it does not need a lot of training data and its ability to combine human heuristics into the computer-assisted decision making process. FL is highly applicable in the domain of RS. The proposed study is to test and provide the predictive performance of the fuzzy-based multi-criteria technique and compare it with a single rating RS. Experimental results on real-world datasets from Yahoo! Movies proved that the proposed technique has remarkably improved the accuracy of the system. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Treatment planning for protons and heavier ions is adapting technologies originally developed for photon dose optimization, but also has to meet its particular challenges. Since the quality of the applied dose is more sensitive to geometric uncertainties, treatment plan robust optimization has a much more prominent role in particle therapy. This has led to specific planning tools, approaches, and research into new formulations of the robust optimization problems. Tools for solution space navigation and automatic planning are also being adapted to particle therapy. These challenges become even greater when detailed models of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) are included into dose optimization, as is required for heavier ions. © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine},

abstract={Estimation of aboveground forest biomass is critical for regional carbon policies and sustainable forest management. Both passive optical remote sensing and active microwave remote sensing can play an important role in the monitoring of forest biomass. In this study, the recently launched Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument satellite and Sentinel-1 SAR satellite systems were evaluated and integrated to investigate the relative strengths of each sensor for mapping aboveground forest biomass at a regional scale. The Australian state of Victoria, with its wide range of forest vegetation was chosen as the study area to demonstrate the scalability and transferability of the approach. In this study aboveground forest biomass (AGB) was defined as the tons of carbon per hectare for the aboveground components (stem, branches, leaves) of all live large trees greater than 10 cm in diameter at breast height (DBHOB). Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data were fused within a machine learning framework using a boosted regression tree model and high-quality ground survey data. Multi-criteria evaluations showed the use of the two independent and fundamentally different Sentinel satellite systems were able to provide robust estimates (R 2 of 0.62, RMSE of 32.2 t.C.ha -1 ) of aboveground forest biomass, with each sensor compensating for the weakness (cloud perturbations and spectral saturation for Sentinel 2, and sensitivity to ground moisture for Sentinel 1) of each other. As archives for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 continue to grow, mapping aboveground forest biomass and dynamics at moderate resolution over large regions should become increasingly feasible. © 2018 IEEE},

To do so, we propose in this paper a supervised learning algorithm since it is a classification problem. Based on requirements specified in the contract called Service Level Agreement (SLA) in IP Multimedia Service (IMS) network, we ended up choosing the decision trees algorithm for several reasons that we will explore later in this work.

abstract={Early diagnosis is still the most important factor to deal with skin cancer, a disease that challenges physicians and researchers. It has benefited from computer-aided diagnosis methods that successfully combine dermoscopy, Digital Image Processing, and Machine Learning techniques. This paper aims to approximate medical professionals working with dermoscopy to these methods, to join the challenge of melanoma early detection. Accordingly, a proposal for extracting, selecting and combining texture and shape features from dermoscopic images is presented. The Feature Selection task is added to the learning process to potentiate the quality of classification models. Three classical Machine Learning algorithms were applied to differentiate melanoma from non-melanoma images. The models are evaluated by standard performance measures and a multi-criteria decision analysis method. This is the first time such method is used in melanoma diagnosis. As a result, we found a decision tree that performs well and allows the explicit representation and analysis of the knowledge learned from the images. In addition, the competitiveness of our decision models in comparison with literature approaches reviewed in this work encourages further applications of Machine Learning and Feature Selection to assist computer-aided diagnosis. © 2018},

In this research paper, Analytic Network Process (ANP) was used to accurately rank ten significant academic conferences based on the specific criteria mentioned above. Machine Learning (ML) algorithm have been used to rank upcoming conferences. The upcoming conferences will be considered based on the condition that the machine learning scores should be more than 80%.

abstract={Protein Structure Comparison (PSC) is a well developed field of computational proteomics with active interest from the research community, since it is widely used in structural biology and drug discovery. With new PSC methods continuously emerging and no clear method of choice, Multi-Criteria Protein Structure Comparison (MCPSC) is commonly employed to combine methods and generate consensus structural similarity scores. We present pyMCPSC, a Python based utility we developed to allow users to perform MCPSC efficiently, by exploiting the parallelism afforded by the multi-core CPUs of today's desktop computers. We show how pyMCPSC facilitates the analysis of similarities in protein domain datasets and how it can be extended to incorporate new PSC methods as they are becoming available. We exemplify the power of pyMCPSC using a case study based on the Proteus-300 dataset. Results generated using pyMCPSC show that MCPSC scores form a reliable basis for identifying the true classification of a domain, as evidenced both by the ROC analysis as well as the Nearest-Neighbor analysis. Structure similarity based Phylogenetic Trees° representation generated by pyMCPSC provide insight into functional grouping within the dataset of domains. Furthermore, scatter plots generated by pyMCPSC show the existence of strong correlation between protein domains belonging to SCOP Class C and loose correlation between those of SCOP Class D. Such analyses and corresponding visualizations help users quickly gain insights about their datasets.

abstract={Rice is an important cereal crop, being a staple food for over half of the world's population, and sexual reproduction resulting in grain formation underpins global food security. However, despite considerable research efforts, many of the genes, especially long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, involved in sexual reproduction in rice remain uncharacterized. With an increasing number of public resources becoming available, information from different sources can be combined to perform gene functional annotation. We report the development of MCRiceRepGP, a machine learning framework which integrates heterogeneous evidence and employs multicriteria decision analysis and machine learning to predict coding and lincRNA genes involved in sexual reproduction in rice. The rice genome was reannotated using deep-sequencing transcriptomic data from reproduction-associated tissue/cell types identifying previously unannotated putative protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. MCRiceRepGP was used for genome-wide discovery of sexual reproduction associated coding and lincRNA genes. The protein-coding and lincRNA genes identified have distinct expression profiles, with a large proportion of lincRNAs reaching maximum expression levels in the sperm cells. Some of the genes are potentially linked to male- and female-specific fertility and heat stress tolerance during the reproductive stage. MCRiceRepGP can be used in combination with other genome-wide studies, such as genome-wide association studies, giving greater confidence that the genes identified are associated with the biological process of interest. As more data, especially about mutant plant phenotypes, become available, the power of MCRiceRepGP will grow, providing researchers with a tool to identify candidate genes for future experiments. MCRiceRepGP is available as a web application (http://mcgplannotator.com/MCRiceRepGP/). © 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

In Germany, political decisions drive the allocation together with investment decisions, social rejections, land use planning, regional development and ecological aspects. Taking all influences into account, a standardized multi-criteria optimization problem combining economic suitability, residential burden and site suitability calculates the regional distribution of wind turbines as input for further assessments. By considering the political framework as boundary conditions for the optimization and detailed geographic area suitability factors using a machine learning approach as input parameters, it is possible to assess effects of regulatory restrictions on regional developments. We use a backtesting for validation and weighting of the objectives. Sensitivities of changing regulatory frameworks modeled as different boundary conditions show effects of changing political decisions. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Generally, a traditional methodology to assess the aesthetics (appreciating beauty) of a photograph involves a number of professional photographers rating the photo based on given criteria and providing ensemble feedback minimize bias. Such a traditional photo assessment method, however, is not applicable to massive users, especially in real-time. To mitigate such an issue, recent studies have devoted on developing algorithms to automatically provide feedback to photo takers. Most of such algorithms train variants of neural networks using ground-truth photos assessed by professional photographers. Regardless, most existing photo assessment algorithms provide the aesthetic score as a single number. From our observation, users typically use multiple criteria to justify the beautifulness of a photo, and hence a single rating score may not be informative. In this paper, we propose a novel Fine-tuned Inception with Fully Connected and Regression Layers model which gives five attribute scores: vivid colour, colour harmony, lighting, balance of elements, and depth of field. T his s olution i ncorporates t he p re-trained inception model which is the state-of-the-art model for processing images. Our proposed algorithm enhances the existing state-of-the-art by fine-tuning the parameters, introducing fully connected layers, and attaching the regression layers to compute the numeric score for each focus attribute. The experimental results show that our model helps to decrease the mean absolute error (MAE) to 0.211, benchmarking on the aesthetics and attributes datasets provided in the previous studies. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Digital technology and social media have brought numerous benefits to human society. TripAdvisor, which runs on user-generated content, provides a platform for travelers to socialize their opinions on several aspects of hotels. Recommendation agents have played an important role for hotel recommendations in the tourism domain. They are valuable tools in e-tourism platforms of travel agencies to help the users in their decision-making process. The recommendation of hotels by multi-criteria Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems is mainly based on their past reviews on several aspects. Hence, recommending the most appropriate hotel to the user is one of the important tasks that a multi-criteria CF needs to do in the e-tourism platform. The aim of this research is to use the multi-criteria ratings in developing a new recommendation method for hotel recommendations in e-tourism platforms. We use supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analysis the customers’ online reviews. The method is evaluated on the data provided by the travelers via TripAdvisor mobile application. The results of our analysis on the dataset confirm that the use of online reviews in the proposed recommendation agent leads to precise recommendations in TripAdvisor. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Indoor positioning system is an active research area. There are various performance metrics such as accuracy, computation time, precision, and f-score in machine learning based indoor positioning systems. The aim of this study is to present a multi-criteria decision strategy to determine suitable machine learning methods for a specific indoor positioning system. This helps to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms considering multiple criteria. During the experiments, UJIIndoorLoc, KIOS and RFKON datasets are used from the positioning literature. The algorithms such as k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, decision tree, naïve bayes and bayesian networks are compared using these datasets. In addition to these, ensemble learning algorithms, namely adaboost and bagging, are utilized to improve the performance of these classifiers. As a conclusion, the test results for any specific dataset are reevaluated using the performance metrics such as accuracy, f-score and computation time, and a multi-criteria decision strategy is proposed to find the most convenient algorithm. The analytical hierarchy process is used for multi-criteria decision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to select the proper machine learning algorithm for an indoor positioning system using multi-criteria decision strategy. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Nowadays, online platform has become a modern means of shopping among people. The reviews of products by customers have been proliferating on the online platform for a while. Since a large number of reviews are available, invariably customers read reviews before buying the product. Majority of the reviews are lengthy and repetitive, some of them even have nothing to do with the product itself. Going through the reviews before making a decision has become a tedious task. Further, the product selection is a complex decision making problem where several criteria are involved in the decision making process. Researchers have used methods like machine learning and sentiment classification to analyze the review of customers to summarize them. However, review summarization does not suggest the best/worst product. This study aims to recommend the best product based on the opinions expressed in the customers' reviews. We analyze the reviews of customers from various online platforms and use effective multi criteria decision making approach to evaluate and recommend the best suitable product. Real-time dataset from Flipkart and Amazon are used to evaluate our system's performance. Different case studies have shown that our proposed method produces a promising result which can help the user in the decision making process. © 2018 IEEE.},

The automatic detection of rivers is of great significance in water resources investigation and water conservancy planning. In this paper, a river target detection algorithm based on multi-feature fusion and soft voting method is proposed. The algorithm firstly divides the images into cells and then extracts the local entropy, texture, spectrum, and color feature of the cells. Random forest is used to train and classify. To optimize the rough detection result of machine learning, the morphology operation and the multi-criteria voting method is introduced. For optimized rough detection result, the level set active contour is used to approach the river shoreline. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has a good detection effect, and the detection accuracy rate of test set reaches 97.44%. In addition, the river can be effectively detected in the complex background. © 2018, Chinese Lasers Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={This paper proposes a multicriteria design optimization methodology for permanent magnet (PM) motors used in electric vehicle (EV) applications. In the process, an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is utilized, coupled with a multiobjective optimization algorithm, as a surrogate model of the electric motor. This allows for the consideration of the full drive cycle and respective efficiency map for every motor design. The prediction error of the ANFIS is minimized by employing appropriate membership functions, initial training data, and an adaptive learning scheme via iterative training. The efficiency map is then implemented in a vehicle dynamic model to compute the total consumed energy over the driving cycle. The optimization profile accounts for total energy efficiency, torque density, and additionally considers complementary design criteria via an a posteriori selection procedure on the resulting Pareto set. The methodology developed is applied to optimize a surface PM motor with concentrated fractional slot winding, mounted on a light EV that competes in fuel economy races. The selected motor design has been validated through measurements on a prototype. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents the interesting observation that by performing fewer of the optimizations available in a standard compiler optimization level such as -O2, while preserving their original ordering, significant savings can be achieved in both execution time and energy consumption. This observation has been validated on two embedded processors, namely the ARM Cortex-M0 and the ARM Cortex-M3, using two different versions of the LLVM compilation framework; v3.8 and v5.0. Experimental evaluation with 71 embedded benchmarks demonstrated performance gains for at least half of the benchmarks for both processors. An average execution time reduction of 2.4% and 5.3% was achieved across all the benchmarks for the Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M3 processors, respectively, with execution time improvements ranging from 1% up to 90% over the -O2. The savings that can be achieved are in the same range as what can be achieved by the state-of-the-art compilation approaches that use iterative compilation or machine learning to select flags or to determine phase orderings that result in more efficient code. In contrast to these time consuming and expensive to apply techniques, our approach only needs to test a limited number of optimization configurations, less than 64, to obtain similar or even better savings.

Expert models, on the other hand, provide structured knowledge that is readily available, yet not often used in machine learning. This paper proposes the integration of expert knowledge, represented in the form of multi-criteria DEX (Decision EXpert) hierarchies or attributes, in a logistic regression stacking framework. We show that integrating expert knowledge into a machine learning framework can improve the quality of models. We tested our hypothesis on the problem for predicting ski injury occurrence, an important decision-support task in ski-resort management. Our results suggest that using a DEX hierarchy of attributes and stacking improves the AUC (area under the curve) compared to logistic regression models unaware of the DEX hierarchy from 1 to 4%. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={During the last decade, Cloud computing has efficiently exploited the economy of scale by providing low cost computational and storage resources over the Internet, eventually leading to consolidation of computing resources into large data centers. However, the nascent of the highly decentralized Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that cannot effectively utilize the centralized Cloud infrastructures pushes computing towards resource dispersion. Fog computing extends the Cloud paradigm by enabling dispersion of the computational and storage resources at the edge of the network in a close proximity to where the data is generated. In its essence, Fog computing facilitates the operation of the limited compute, storage and networking resources physically located close to the edge devices. However, the shared complexity of the Fog and the influence of the recent IoT trends moving towards deploying and interconnecting extremely large sets of pervasive devices and sensors, requires exploration of adaptive Fog architectural approaches capable of adapting and scaling in response to the unpredictable load patterns of the distributed IoT applications. In this paper we introduce a promising new nature- inspired Fog architecture, named SmartFog, capable of providing low decision making latency and adaptive resource management. By utilizing novel algorithms and techniques from the fields of multi- criteria decision making, graph theory and machine learning we model the Fog as a distributed intelligent processing system, therefore emulating the function of the human brain. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Existing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) based communication suffers from various security and performance issues, hence Cluster based Communication is preferred nowadays. However, Cluster based Communication adds extra overhead and burden on the Cluster Head (CH) in dense network scenarios which eventually introduces delay and hinders network performance. To reduce the overburdening of single CH, a multi cluster head scheme is proposed in which multiple nodes in a cluster can act as CH to share the load of single CH. For a selection of stable CH, Hybrid Fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision making approach (HF-MCDM) is proposed in which Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS methods are clubbed together for optimal decision making. Further because of association of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) with life-critical applications, there is a dire need for a security framework to detect various malevolent attacks. Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) like Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the approaches for curbing such attacks. These intrusion detection based mechanism can be combined with various existing optimization techniques to improve their performance, and Dolphin Swarm Algorithm is one such approach. Dolphins have many significant biological features like echolocation, exchange of information, coordination, and division of labor. These biological features combined with swarm intelligence can be utilized for optimizing the detection and accuracy of SVM based IDS. So in this paper, a Multi-Cluster Head anomaly based IDS optimized by Dolphin Swarm Algorithm has been proposed and its results are compared with various existing Security frameworks in terms of parameters like false positive, detection rate, detection time, etc. and it is observed that the proposed approach performs better. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Recommender systems are powerful intelligent systems that are considered as solutions to the problems of information overload. They provide personalized lists of recommended items to users using some machine learning techniques. Traditionally, the existing recommender systems used single rating techniques to estimate users' opinions on items. However, as preferences of the users might depend on several items' attributes, the efficiency of the traditional single rating recommender systems are considered to be limited since it can not account for the various items' attributes. A multi-criteria recommendation is a new technique that uses ratings to various items' attributes to make more efficient predictions. Nevertheless, despite the proven accuracy improvements of multi-criteria recommendation technique, research needs to be done continuously to establish an efficient way of modelling the criteria ratings. Therefore, this paper proposed to use an adaptive genetic algorithm to model multi-criteria recommendation problems using an aggregation function approach. The empirical results presented in this paper have shown that the multi-criteria recommendation technique using adaptive genetic algorithm has by far provided more accurate predictions than traditional recommendation approach. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Estimating maximum possible rainfall is of great value for flood prediction and protection, particularly for regions, such as Canada, where urban and fluvial floods from extreme rainfalls have been known to be a major concern. In this study, a methodology is proposed to forecast real-time rainfall (with one month lead time) using different number of spatial inputs with different orders of lags. For this purpose, two types of models are used. The first one is a machine learning data driven-based model, which uses a set of hydrologic variables as inputs, and the second one is an empirical-statistical model that employs the multi-criteria decision analysis method for rainfall forecasting. The data driven model is built based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while the developed multi-criteria decision analysis model uses Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach. A comprehensive set of spatially varying climate variables, including geopotential height, sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, humidity, temperature and pressure with different orders of lags is collected to form input vectors for the forecast models. Then, a feature selection method is employed to identify the most appropriate predictors. Two sets of results from the developed models, i.e., maximum daily rainfall in each month (RMAX) and cumulative value of rainfall for each month (RCU), are considered as the target variables for forecast purpose. The results from both modeling approaches are compared using a number of evaluation criteria such as Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). The proposed models are applied for rainfall forecasting for a coastal area in Western Canada: Vancouver, British Columbia. Results indicate although data driven models such as ANNs work well for the simulation purpose, developed TOPSIS model considerably outperforms ANNs for the rainfall forecasting. ANNs show acceptable simulation performance during the calibration period (NSE up to 0.9) but they fail for the validation (NSE of 0.2) and forecasting (negative NSE). The TOPSIS method delivers better rainfall forecasting performance with the NSE of about 0.7. Moreover, the number of predictors that are used in the TOPSIS model are significantly less than those required by the ANNs to show an acceptable performance (7 against 47 for forecasting RCU and 6 against 32 for forecasting RMAX). Reliable and precise rainfall forecasting, with adequate lead time, benefits enhanced flood warning and decision making to reduce potential flood damages. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Hazard identification is the key step in risk assessment and management of manufactured nanomaterials (NM). However, the rapid commercialisation of nano-enabled products continues to out-pace the development of a prudent risk management mechanism that is widely accepted by the scientific community and enforced by regulators. However, a growing body of academic literature is developing promising quantitative methods. Two approaches have gained significant currency. Bayesian networks (BN) are a probabilistic, machine learning approach while the weight of evidence (WoE) statistical framework is based on expert elicitation. This comparative study investigates the efficacy of quantitativeWoE and Bayesian methodologies in ranking the potential hazard of metal and metal-oxide NMs—TiO2, Ag, and ZnO. This research finds that hazard ranking is consistent for both risk assessment approaches. The BN andWoE models both utilize physico-chemical, toxicological, and study type data to infer the hazard potential. The BN exhibits more stability when the models are perturbed with new data. The BN has the significant advantage of self-learning with new data; however, this assumes all input data is equally valid. This research finds that a combination of WoE that would rank input data along with the BN is the optimal hazard assessment framework. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper presents the integration of a cognitive architecture with an intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an autonomous non-deterministic safety critical system. The IDSM will integrate multi-criteria decision making via intelligent technologies like expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning and genetic algorithms. Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety–critical systems to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system's cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an actual safety–critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV's safety performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing model to evaluate a cognitive architecture's ability to ensure safe performance of an intelligent safety–critical system. The IDSM does this by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making associated with the cognitive architecture's key safety parameters (KSP). Other real-time applications that could benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers a reference for safety engineering artificially intelligent safety–critical systems. © 2017},

abstract={Data mining classification techniques have been studied extensively for credit risk assessment. Existing techniques by default uses 0.5 as the cutoff irrespective of datasets and classifiers to predict the binary outcomes, thus limiting their classification performance on imbalanced group sizes of datasets. This paper addresses two key problems with the existing techniques and talks about the advantages of using Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique on multiple evaluation criteria. The first key problem is applying default cutoff irrespective of datasets and classifiers. The second one is utilizing single criteria for evaluating classification performance and predicting cutoff point. This research work identifies the best cutoff point with respect to datasets and classifiers and integrates MCDM under fuzzy environment in all data mining stages of evaluation to take better decisions on multiple criteria, selection of initial random seed in the clustering phase for better cluster quality and Best Seed Clustering combined Classification (BSCC hybrid algorithm) with selected features to improve classification performance. The integration of these techniques gives a better hand to improve cluster quality and classification performance score with respect to datasets and classifiers because the cutoff point varies from dataset to dataset and classifiers to classifiers. Experimental outcomes from applied credit dataset of UCI machine learning repository found to be competitive and the proposed BSCC hybrid algorithm increases the performance score on obtained cutoff point over non-hybrid approach with default cutoff. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.},

abstract={Due to high implementation rates of smart meter systems, considerable amount of research is placed in machine learning tools for data handling and information retrieval. A key tool in load data processing is clustering. In recent years, a number of researches have proposed different clustering algorithms in the load profiling field. The present paper provides a methodology for addressing the aforementioned problem through Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and namely, using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). A comparison of the algorithms is employed. Next, a single test case on the selection of an algorithm is examined. User specific weights are applied and based on these weight values, the optimal algorithm is drawn. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={In machine learning, the notion of multi-objective model selection (MOMS) refers to the problem of identifying the set of Pareto-optimal models that optimize by compromising more than one predefined objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces SPRINT-Race, the first multi-objective racing algorithm in a fixed-confidence setting, which is based on the sequential probability ratio with indifference zone test. SPRINT-Race addresses the problem of MOMS with multiple stochastic optimization objectives in the proper Pareto-optimality sense. In SPRINT-Race, a pairwise dominance or non-dominance relationship is statistically inferred via a non-parametric, ternary-decision, dual-sequential probability ratio test. The overall probability of falsely eliminating any Pareto-optimal models or mistakenly returning any clearly dominated models is strictly controlled by a sequential Holm's step-down family-wise error rate control method. As a fixed-confidence model selection algorithm, the objective of SPRINT-Race is to minimize the computational effort required to achieve a prescribed confidence level about the quality of the returned models. The performance of SPRINT-Race is first examined via an artificially constructed MOMS problem with known ground truth. Subsequently, SPRINT-Race is applied on two real-world applications: 1) hybrid recommender system design and 2) multi-criteria stock selection. The experimental results verify that SPRINT-Race is an effective and efficient tool for such MOMS problems. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the increasing size and complexity of construction projects, construction engineering and management involves the coordination of many complex and dynamic processes and relies on the analysis of uncertain, imprecise and incomplete information, including subjective and linguistically expressed information. Various modelling and computing techniques have been used by construction researchers and applied to practical construction problems in order to overcome these challenges, including fuzzy hybrid techniques. Fuzzy hybrid techniques combine the human-like reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic with the capabilities of other techniques, such as optimization, machine learning, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and simulation, to capitalise on their strengths and overcome their limitations. Based on a review of construction literature, this chapter identifies the most common types of fuzzy hybrid techniques applied to construction problems and reviews selected papers in each category of fuzzy hybrid technique to illustrate their capabilities for addressing construction challenges. Finally, this chapter discusses areas for future development of fuzzy hybrid techniques that will increase their capabilities for solving construction-related problems. The contributions of this chapter are threefold: (1) the limitations of some standard techniques for solving construction problems are discussed, as are the ways that fuzzy methods have been hybridized with these techniques in order to address their limitations; (2) a review of existing applications of fuzzy hybrid techniques in construction is provided in order to illustrate the capabilities of these techniques for solving a variety of construction problems and (3) potential improvements in each category of fuzzy hybrid technique in construction are provided, as areas for future research. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The insurance market is going through revolutionary change - Internet of Things, Telematics and sensor technologies, Machine Learning (MA) with intelligent automation, growth of Cyber insurance, Big Data analytics and online ecosystems with cloud computing will significantly change the landscape of the insurance services market. In this paper, a multi-criteria decision-making methodology (MCDM), Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP), is applied in the Latvian insurance market to assess the strategic decision making criteria. As soon as nowadays managers have high risk of contradiction in pairwise comparisons due to market dynamics and high level of uncertainty, the proposed evaluation model is based on the use of the consistency-driven linguistic methodology. The subject of the study is the influence of digitalization on customer preferences and development of Latvian insurance companies' strategies. The purpose of this work is to study the development of insurance company strategies based on the shift of the perception values of clients, employees and owners of insurance companies in the era of digital transformation. According to the research results digital transformation is showing shift of customer perception values: simple product gives a greater benefit to the fact that owner only has to enter minimum information, so it is recommended to use smart-functions provided by digital opportunities to meet consumer's expectations. Within the scope of the survey, e-services perception values are mostly associated with the availability of product descriptions and comparison (aggregators), simple payment or online advisers.

abstract={The number of connected Internet of Things devices is forecast to grow to more than 31 billion globally in 2018. Many of these devices are/will be connecting to physical assets, and data collected from these devices can be used to model, manage, or describe these assets. We are motivated by utilizing these abundant data for assets’ resources requirements ranking. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis, MCDA, has often been utilized in finding ranking by computing on collected data and predefined criteria. However, changes in asset’s environment have a direct impact on its resource requirements ranking and decisions on ranking must be constantly revised. This is a repetitive process where managers require to repetitively adjusting the decisions on the ranking. With machine learning, such repetitiveness can be heavily minimized by teaching machines how to rank not by instruction but rather by examples of the task being done. In this paper, we present Learn to Rank, LTR, machine learning framework in conjunction with MCDA for warehouse resources requirements ranking application. A framework for smart contract renegotiate resources allocation ranking for each asset on the blockchains is also discussed. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Three different configurations of the Saarbrucken voice database (SVD) are used. The effect of using balanced and unbalanced versions of this dataset is proved as well as the usefulness of the considered optimization algorithm to improve the final performance outcomes.

abstract={The growth of computer networks from LAN to cloud, virtualisation and mobility always keeps intrusion detection system (IDS) as a critical component in the field of network security infrastructure. Tremendous growth and usage of internet raises concerns about how to protect and communicate the digital information in a safe manner. The market for security solutions for next-generation is rapidly evolving and constantly changing to accommodate today’s threat. Many intrusion detection techniques, methods and algorithms are implemented to detect these novel attacks. But there’s no clear feature set, uncertainty bounds established as a baseline for dynamic environments. The main objective of this paper is to determine and provide the best feature selection for next generation dynamic environments using multi-criteria decision making, decision tree learning with emphasis on optimisation (contingency of weight allocation) and handling large datasets.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized by a broad range of resources connected to the Internet, requesting and providing services simultaneously. Given this scenario, suitably selecting the resources that best meet users’ demands has been a relevant and current research challenge. Based on the non-functional parameters of Quality of Service (QoS), IoT plays an important role in the ranking of these resources according to the offered services. This paper presents a proposal to classify and select the most appropriate resource for the client’s request, applying fuzzy logic to address uncertainties in the definition of ideal weights for QoS attributes, and aggregating machine learning to the pre-classification of EXEHDA middleware resources, in order to reduce the computational cost generated by MCDA algorithms. As the main contribution, the pre-classification of new resources of the EXEHDA-RR is presented. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed model. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={The accurate prediction of manufacturing lead times (LT) significantly influences the quality and efficiency of production planning and scheduling (PPS). Traditional planning and control methods mostly calculate average lead times, derived from historical data. This often results in the deficiency of PPS, as production planners cannot consider the variability of LT, affected by multiple criteria in today's complex manufacturing environment. In case of semiconductor manufacturing, sophisticated LT prediction methods are needed, due to complex operations, mass production, multiple routings and demands to high process resource efficiency. To overcome these challenges, supervised machine learning (ML) approaches can be employed for LT prediction, relying on historical production data obtained from manufacturing execution systems (MES). The paper examines the use of state-of-the-art regression algorithms and their effect on increasing accuracy of LT prediction. Through a real industrial case study, a multi-criteria comparison of the methods is provided, and conclusions are drawn about the selection of features and applicability of the methods in the semiconductor industry. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Nowadays, User-Generated Content (UGC) spreads across social media through Web 2.0 technologies, in the absence of traditional trusted third parties that can verify its credibility. The issue of assessing the credibility of UGC is a recent research topic, which has been tackled by many approaches as a classification problem: information is automatically categorized into genuine and fake, usually by employing data-driven solutions, based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In this paper, to address some open issues concerning the use of ML, and to give to the decision maker a major control on the process of UGC credibility assessment, the importance that the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) paradigm can have in association with the use of aggregation operators is discussed. Some potential aggregation schemes and their properties are illustrated, as well as some interesting research directions. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={With advancements in machine learning algorithms and computer aided diagnostic (CAD) systems, the performance of automated analysis of radiological images has improved substantially in recent times. However, the lack of integration between the radiologist and CAD systems restrains the rate of progress as well as the reach of such advancements in clinical use. This article aims to improve the clinical efficiency of ultrasound based CAD systems for classification of breast lesions by integrating back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), support vector machine (SVM) and radiologist feedback. The acquired breast ultrasound images were subjected to wavelet based filtering in order to reduce speckle noise followed by feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Experiments on a database of 178 ultrasound images of breast anomalies (88 benign and 90 malignant) show that the proposed methodology achieves classification accuracy of 98.621% and 98.276%, respectively, when all 457 and 19 most relevant features selected by multi-criteria feature selection method were used for classification. The accuracy achieved is significantly higher than that using conventional classifiers based on BPANN and SVM. Further, it is found that integrating expert opinion in CAD systems improves its overall performance. The quantitative results obtained are discussed in light of some recently reported studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) by online broker to rank different service providers in the Cloud is based upon criteria provided by a customer. However, such ranking is prone to bias if the customer has insufficient domain knowledge. He/she may exclude relevant or include irrelevant criterion termed as 'misspecification of criterion'. This causes structural uncertainty within the MCDA leading to selection of suboptimal service provider by online broker. To cater such issue, we propose a self-regulatedMCDA, which uses notion of factor analysis from the field of statistics. Two QoS based datasets were used for evaluation of proposed model. The prior dataset i.e., feedback from customers, was compiled using leading review websites such as Cloud Hosting Reviews, Best Cloud Computing Providers, and Cloud Storage Reviews and Ratings. The later dataset i.e., feedback from servers, was generated from Cloud brokerage architecture that was emulated using high performance computing (HPC) cluster at University of Luxembourg (HPC @ Uni.lu). The results show better performance of proposed model as compared to its counterparts in the field. The beneficiary of the research would be enterprises that view insufficient domain knowledge as a limiting factor for acquisition of Cloud services. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Scene recognition is a significant and challenging problem in the field of computer vision. One of the principal bottlenecks in applying machine learning techniques to scene recognition tasks is the requirement of a large number of labeled training data. However, labeling massive training data manually (especially labeling images and videos) is very expensive in terms of human time and effort. In this paper, we present a novel multicriteria-based active discriminative dictionary learning (M-ADDL) algorithm to reduce the human annotation effort and create a robust scene recognition model. The M-ADDL algorithm possesses three advantages. First, M-ADDL introduces an active learning strategy into the discriminative dictionary learning model so that the performance of discriminative dictionary learning can be improved when the number of labeled samples is small. Second, different from most existing active learning methods that measure either the informativeness or representativeness of unlabeled samples to select useful samples for expanding the training dataset, M-ADDL employs both informativeness and representativeness to query useful unlabeled samples and utilizes the manifold-preserving ability of unlabeled samples as an additional sample selection criterion. Finally, a more effective representativeness criterion is presented based on the reconstruction coefficients of the samples. The experimental results of four standard scene recognition databases demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed M-ADDL algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.},

As cost functions, we consider depth, average depth, number of nodes, and number of terminal/nonterminal nodes in trees. Decision tables with many-valued decisions (multi-label decision tables) are often more accurate models for real-life data sets than usual decision tables with single-valued decisions. Inhibitory trees can sometimes capture more information from decision tables than decision trees. In this paper, we create dynamic programming algorithms for multi-stage optimization of trees relative to a sequence of cost functions. We apply these algorithms to prove the existence of totally optimal (simultaneously optimal relative to a number of cost functions) decision and inhibitory trees for some modified decision tables from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Conventional coronary heart disease (CHD) detection methods are expensive, rely much on doctors' subjective experience, and some of them have side effects. In order to obtain rapid, high-precision, low-cost, non-invasive detection results, several methods in machine learning were attempted for CHD detection in this paper. The paper adopted multiple evaluation criteria to measure features, combined with heuristic search strategy and seven common classification algorithms to verify the validity and the importance of feature selection (FS) in the Z-Alizadeh Sani CHD dataset. On this basis, a novelty algorithm integrating multiple FS methods into the ensemble algorithm (ensemble algorithm based on multiple feature selection, EA-MFS) was further proposed. The algorithm adopted Bagging approach to increase data diversity, used the aforementioned MFS methods for functional perturbation, employed major voting method to carry out the decision results, and performed selective integration in terms of the difference of base classifiers in the ensemble process. Compared with the single FS method, the EA-MFS algorithm could comprehensively describe the relationship of features, enhance the classification effect, and displayed better robustness. That meant the EA-MFS algorithm could reduce the dependence on dataset and strengthen the stability of the algorithm, all of which were of great significance for the clinical application of machine learning algorithm in coronary heart disease detection. © 2017 National Taiwan University.},

abstract={Classification in an imbalanced dataset is a current challenge in machine learning communities, as the class-imbalanced problem deteriorates the performance of numerous classifiers. This study introduces a two-stage intelligent data preprocessing approach to tackle the class-imbalanced problem. By modifying the penalty parameter of the support vector machine (SVM), the discriminating boundary will move toward the majority class and in turn misclassify the majority class examples as minority class examples. That is, more misclassifications for the majority class examples are equivalent to a greater number of minority class examples. Executing the SVM as a preprocessor can be used to overcome the class imbalanced problem. Sequentially, the modified dataset undergoes the random forest to defy the curse of dimensionality. Finally, the preprocessed data are fed into a rule-based classifier to generate comprehensive decision rules. According to the empirical results, the presented architecture is a promising alternative for the class-imbalanced problem. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The biggest share of the quality of new concept is that technical aspects of products and services combine with customers usage and understanding.

abstract={Cloud computing is the expansion of parallel computing, distributed computing. The technology of cloud computing becomes more and more widely used, and one of the fundamental issues in this cloud environment is related to task scheduling. However, scheduling in Cloud environments represents a difficult issue since it is basically NP-complete. Thus, many variants based on approximation techniques, especially those inspired by Swarm Intelligence (SI) have been proposed. This paper proposes a machine learning algorithm to guide the cloud choose the scheduling technique by using multi criteria decision to optimize the performance. The main contribution of our work is to minimize the makespan of a given task set. The new strategy is simulated using the CloudSim toolkit package where the impact of the algorithm is checked with different numbers of VMs varying from 2 to 50, and different task sizes between 30 bytes and 2700 bytes. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm minimizes the execution time and the makespan between 7% and 75%, and improves the performance of the load balancing scheduling. © 2017 IEEE.},

The problem of constructing a linear preference function model is reduced to weighting coefficients estimation for features or particular criteria and is solved on basis of corresponding optimization problem with constraints. The problem of constructing a non-linear model is solved on the basis of kernel-based learning approach that allows approximating the preference function of complex structure on small training samples.

abstract={Knowledge extraction is an important part of e-Health system. However, datasets in health domain are highly imbalanced, voluminous, conflicting and complex in nature, and these can lead to erroneous diagnosis of diseases. So, designing accurate and robust clinical diagnosis models for such datasets is a challenging task in data mining. In literature, numerous standard intelligent models have been proposed for this purpose but they usually suffer from several drawbacks like lack of understandability, incapability of operating rare cases, inefficiency in making quick and correct decision, etc. In fact, specific health application using standard intelligent methods may not satisfy multiple criteria. However, recent research indicates that hybrid intelligent methods (integrating several standard ones, can achieve better performance for health applications. Addressing the limitations of the existing approaches, the present research introduces a new hybrid predictive model (integrating C4.5 and PRISM learners) for diagnosing effectively the diseases (instead of any specific disease) in comprehensible way by the practitioners with better prediction results in comparison to the traditional approaches. The empirical results (in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and false positive rate) obtained over fourteen benchmark datasets demonstrate that the model outperforms the base learners in almost all cases. The performance of the model also claims that it can be good alternative to the specialized learners (each designed for specific disease) published in the literature. After all, the presented intelligent system is effective in undertaking medical data classification task. © 2017 European Society for Translational Medicine},

abstract={We define tephras and cryptotephras and their components (mainly ash-sized particles of glass ± crystals in distal deposits) and summarize the basis of tephrochronology as a chronostratigraphic correlational and dating tool for palaeoenvironmental, geological, and archaeological research. We then document and appraise recent advances in analytical methods used to determine the major, minor, and trace elements of individual glass shards from tephra or cryptotephra deposits to aid their correlation and application. Protocols developed recently for the electron probe microanalysis of major elements in individual glass shards help to improve data quality and standardize reporting procedures. A narrow electron beam (diameter ∼3–5 μm) can now be used to analyze smaller glass shards than previously attainable. Reliable analyses of ‘microshards’ (defined here as glass shards &lt;32 μm in diameter) using narrow beams are useful for fine-grained samples from distal or ultra-distal geographic locations, and for vesicular or microlite-rich glass shards or small melt inclusions. Caveats apply, however, in the microprobe analysis of very small microshards (≤∼5 μm in diameter), where particle geometry becomes important, and of microlite-rich glass shards where the potential problem of secondary fluorescence across phase boundaries needs to be recognised. Trace element analyses of individual glass shards using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), with crater diameters of 20 μm and 10 μm, are now effectively routine, giving detection limits well below 1 ppm. Smaller ablation craters (&lt;10 μm) can be subject to significant element fractionation during analysis, but the systematic relationship of such fractionation with glass composition suggests that analyses for some elements at these resolutions may be quantifiable. In undertaking analyses, either by microprobe or LA-ICP-MS, reference material data acquired using the same procedure, and preferably from the same analytical session, should be presented alongside new analytical data. In part 2 of the review, we describe, critically assess, and recommend ways in which tephras or cryptotephras can be correlated (in conjunction with other information) using numerical or statistical analyses of compositional data. Statistical methods provide a less subjective means of dealing with analytical data pertaining to tephra components (usually glass or crystals/phenocrysts) than heuristic alternatives. They enable a better understanding of relationships among the data from multiple viewpoints to be developed and help quantify the degree of uncertainty in establishing correlations. In common with other scientific hypothesis testing, it is easier to infer using such analysis that two or more tephras are different rather than the same. Adding stratigraphic, chronological, spatial, or palaeoenvironmental data (i.e. multiple criteria) is usually necessary and allows for more robust correlations to be made. A two-stage approach is useful, the first focussed on differences in the mean composition of samples, or their range, which can be visualised graphically via scatterplot matrices or bivariate plots coupled with the use of statistical tools such as distance measures, similarity coefficients, hierarchical cluster analysis (informed by distance measures or similarity or cophenetic coefficients), and principal components analysis (PCA). Some statistical methods (cluster analysis, discriminant analysis) are referred to as ‘machine learning’ in the computing literature. The second stage examines sample variance and the degree of compositional similarity so that sample equivalence or otherwise can be established on a statistical basis. This stage may involve discriminant function analysis (DFA), support vector machines (SVMs), canonical variates analysis (CVA), and ANOVA or MANOVA (or its two-sample special case, the Hotelling two-sample T2 test). Randomization tests can be used where distributional assumptions such as multivariate normality underlying parametric tests are doubtful. Compositional data may be transformed and scaled before being subjected to multivariate statistical procedures including calculation of distance matrices, hierarchical cluster analysis, and PCA. Such transformations may make the assumption of multivariate normality more appropriate. A sequential procedure using Mahalanobis distance and the Hotelling two-sample T2 test is illustrated using glass major element data from trachytic to phonolitic Kenyan tephras. All these methods require a broad range of high-quality compositional data which can be used to compare ‘unknowns’ with reference (training) sets that are sufficiently complete to account for all possible correlatives, including tephras with heterogeneous glasses that contain multiple compositional groups. Currently, incomplete databases are tending to limit correlation efficacy. The development of an open, online global database to facilitate progress towards integrated, high-quality tephrostratigraphic frameworks for different regions is encouraged. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The therapeutic effects of drugs are well known to result from their interaction with multiple intracellular targets. Accordingly, the pharma industry is currently moving from a reductionist approach based on a ‘one-target fixation’ to a holistic multitarget approach. However, many drug discovery practices are still procedural abstractions resulting from the attempt to understand and address the action of biologically active compounds while preventing adverse effects. Here, we discuss how drug discovery can benefit from the principles of evolutionary biology and report two real-life case studies. We do so by focusing on the desirability principle, and its many features and applications, such as machine learning-based multicriteria virtual screening. Here, we describe a multicriteria virtual screening approach based on desirability functions and tailored ensemble machine-learning classifiers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Most of the previous studies on the user preferences assume that there is a personal transitive preference ranking of the consumable media like images. For example, the transitivity of preferences is one of the most important assumptions in the recommender system research. However, the intransitive relations have also been widely observed, such as the win/loss relations in online video games, in sport matches, and even in rock-paper-scissors games. It is also found that different subjects demonstrate the personalized intransitive preferences in the pairwise comparisons between the applicants for college admission. Since the intransitivity of preferences on images has barely been studied before and has a large impact on the research of personalized image search and recommendation, it is necessary to propose a novel method to predict the personalized intransitive preferences of images. In this paper, we propose the novel Multi-Criterion preference (MuCri) models to predict the intransitive relations in the image preferences. The MuCri models utilize different kinds of image content features as well as the latent features of users and images. Meanwhile, a new data set is constructed in this paper, in order to evaluate the performance of the MuCri models. The experimental evaluation shows that the MuCri models outperform all the baselines. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this topic, we believe it would widely attract the attention of researchers in the image processing community as well as in other communities, such as machine learning, multimedia, and recommender system. © 2017 IEEE.},

The base algorithm and most of the variants uses an update equation to improve the solutions. The update equation finds a feasible movement based on neighbor solutions and adds that movement to current to create a mutant solution. If the mutant solution is better than the original one then original solution is updated. None of the ABC variant use a successful movement again. In this work when a successful move found then it is used again. Proposed approach is applied to ABCVSS algorithm which is a recently proposed ABC variant and that modified ABCVSS algorithm (ABCVSSRSM) is tested on numerical benchmark functions and results compared the well-known ABC variants. Results show that proposed method is superior under multiple criteria.},

abstract={This article addresses a scheduling problem for a chemical research laboratory. Activities with potentially variable, non-rectangular resource allocation profiles must be scheduled on discrete renewable resources. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for the problem includes maximum time lags, custom resource allocation constraints, and multiple nonstandard objectives. We present a list scheduling heuristic that mimics the human decision maker and thus provides reference solutions. These solutions are the basis for an automated learning-based determination of coefficients for the convex combination of objectives used by the MIP and a dedicated variable neighborhood search (VNS) approach. The development of the VNS also involves the design of new neighborhood structures that prove particularly effective for the custom objectives under consideration. Relative improvements of up to 60% are achievable for isolated objectives, as demonstrated by the final computational study based on a broad spectrum of randomly generated instances of different sizes and real-world data from the company's live system. © 2017 The Operational Research Society.},

abstract={Accurate fault diagnosis systems should consider both the historical performance and the assessment of the current state of a machine. Manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance are part of the machine's history and should be taken into account. The paper focuses on experimental procedures to develop a multi-criteria methodology to classify up to ten machine conditions. Using machine learning for signal processing techniques, any deviation from a normal steady state might be categorized as an abnormal behavior and, when demonstrated, a fault. To take advantage of machine learning algorithms, a significant amount of data is needed. To demonstrate the procedure the authors examined a synchronous machine. The authors recorded currents and voltages primarily, in stator and rotor winding, well as rotational speed and electromechanical torque. The collected signals were filtered and pre-processed, and to 5038 features were calculated and transformed into a tidy dataset. The sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm was used to extract the most important defined features. The results are shown in 3D scatter plots; in which each machine condition is represented. It is then possible to visualize the ability of the model to identify the most discriminant features. The same method can be used for the diagnostic of other types of machine conditions. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Supplier selection is a critical multi-criteria decision making problem for supply chain management. With the emergence of big data, there is an urgent need for data-driven decision making methods. A hybrid DEA-Adaboost model is proposed to meet the challenge. The proposed model is split into the DEA and the learner. The fuzzy multi-objective DEA is used to build the expert database, which contains the appropriate and inappropriate suppliers. The learner is trained by Adaboost from the expert database. Thus, the DEA and derived learner are combined as the hybrid model to reduce the time consumption and computational complexities for suppliers selection. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the accuracy compared with other two approaches. © 2017},

abstract={Recommender systems have emerged in the e-commerce domain and are developed to actively recommend the right items to online users. Traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems recommend the items to users based on their single-rating feedback which are used to match similar users. In multi-criteria CF recommender systems, however, multi-criteria ratings are used instead of single-rating feedback which can significantly improve the accuracy of traditional CF algorithms. These systems have been successfully implemented in Tourism domain. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation method based on multi-criteria CF to enhance the predictive accuracy of recommender systems in tourism domain using clustering, dimensionality reduction and prediction methods. We use Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) as prediction techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a dimensionality reduction technique and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Expectation Maximization (EM) as two well-known clustering techniques. To improve the recommendation accuracy of proposed multi-criteria CF, a cluster ensembles approach, Hypergraph Partitioning Algorithm (HGPA), is applied on SOM and EM clustering results. We evaluate the accuracy of recommendation method on TripAdvisior dataset. Our experiments confirm that cluster ensembles can provide better predictive accuracy for the proposed recommendation method in relation to the methods which solely rely on single clustering techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In Data Mining, during the preprocessing step, there is a considerable diversity of candidate algorithms to select important features, according to some criteria. This broad availability of algorithms that perform the Feature Selection task gives rise to the difficulty of choosing, a priori, between the algorithms at hand, the most promising one for a particular problem. In this paper, we present the proposal and evaluation of a new architecture for the recommendation of Feature Selection algorithms based on the use of Metalearning. Our framework is very flexible since the user can adapt it to its proper needs. This flexibility is one of the main advantages of our proposal over other approaches in the literature, which involve steps that cannot be adapted to the user's local requirements. Furthermore, it combines several concepts of intelligent systems, including Machine Learning and Data Mining, with topics derived from expert systems, as user and data-driven knowledge, with meta-knowledge. This set of solutions coupled with leading-edge technologies allows our architecture to be integrated into any information system, which impact on the automation of services and in reducing human effort during the process. Regarding the Metalearning process, our framework considers several types of properties inherent to the data sets, as well as, Feature Selection algorithms based on many information, distance, dependence and consistency measures. The quality of the methods for Feature Selection was estimated according to a multicriteria performance measure, which guided the ranking process of these algorithms for the construction of data metabases. Proposed by the authors of this work, this multicriteria performance measure combines any three measurements on a single one, creating an interesting and powerful tool to evaluate not only FS algorithms but also to assess any context where it is necessary a combination to maximize a measure or minimize it. The recommendation models, represented by decision trees and induced from the training metabases, allowed us to see in what circumstances a Feature Selection algorithm outperforms the other and what aspects of the data present greater influence in determining the performance of these algorithms. Nevertheless, if the user wishes, any other learning algorithm may be used to induce the recommendation model. This versatility is another strong point of this proposal. Results show that with the characterization of data, through statistical, information and complexity measures, it is possible to reach an accuracy higher than 90%. Besides yielding recommendation models that are interpretable and robust to overfitting, the developed architecture is less computationally expensive than approaches recently proposed in the literature. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Social Web is characterized by a massive diffusion of unfiltered content, directly generated by users via the spread of different social media platforms. In this context, a challenging issue is to assess the veracity of the information generated within the sites of online reviews. To address this issue, a common practice in the literature is to select and analyze some veracity features associated with users and their reviews, by mostly applying machine learning techniques, to provide a classification in genuine and deceptive reviews. In this paper, we do not focus on the feature selection and user behavior analysis issues, but we concentrate on the aggregation process with respect to each single veracity feature. In most of the approaches based on machine learning techniques, the contribution of each feature in the classification process is not measurable by the user. For this reason, we propose a multicriteria decision making approach based both on the assessment of multiple criteria and the use of aggregation operators with the aim of obtaining a veracity score associated with each review. Based on this score, it is possible to detect fake reviews. The proposed model is evaluated on a Yelp data set by applying different aggregation schemes, and it is compared with well-known supervised machine learning techniques. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Objective Manual evaluation of machine learning algorithms and selection of a suitable classifier from the list of available candidate classifiers, is highly time consuming and challenging task. If the selection is not carefully and accurately done, the resulting classification model will not be able to produce the expected performance results. In this study, we present an accurate multi-criteria decision making methodology (AMD) which empirically evaluates and ranks classifiers’ and allow end users or experts to choose the top ranked classifier for their applications to learn and build classification models for them. Methods and material Existing classifiers performance analysis and recommendation methodologies lack (a) appropriate method for suitable evaluation criteria selection, (b) relative consistent weighting mechanism, (c) fitness assessment of the classifiers’ performances, and (d) satisfaction of various constraints during the analysis process. To assist machine learning practitioners in the selection of suitable classifier(s), AMD methodology is proposed that presents an expert group-based criteria selection method, relative consistent weighting scheme, a new ranking method, called optimum performance ranking criteria, based on multiple evaluation metrics, statistical significance and fitness assessment functions, and implicit and explicit constraints satisfaction at the time of analysis. For ranking the classifiers performance, the proposed ranking method integrates Wgt.Avg.F-score, CPUTimeTesting, CPUTimeTraining, and Consistency measures using the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The final relative closeness score produced by TOPSIS, is ranked and the practitioners select the best performance (top-ranked) classifier for their problems in-hand. Findings Based on the extensive experiments performed on 15 publically available UCI and OpenML datasets using 35 classification algorithms from heterogeneous families of classifiers, an average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.98 is observed. Similarly, the AMD method has showed improved performance of 0.98 average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as compared to 0.83 and 0.045 correlation coefficient of the state-of-the-art ranking methods, performance of algorithms (PAlg) and adjusted ratio of ratio (ARR). Conclusion and implication The evaluation, empirical analysis of results and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the feasibility of AMD methodology, especially the selection and weighting of right evaluation criteria, accurate ranking and selection of optimum performance classifier(s) for the user's application's data in hand. AMD reduces expert's time and efforts and improves system performance by designing suitable classifier recommended by AMD methodology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Dry eye is an increasingly common disease in modern society which affects a wide range of population and has a negative impact on their daily activities, such as working with computers or driving. It can be diagnosed through an automatic clinical test for tear film lipid layer classification based on color and texture analysis. Up to now, researchers have mainly focused on the improvement of the image analysis step. However, there is still large room for improvement on the machine learning side. This paper presents a methodology to optimize this problem by means of class binarization, feature selection, and classification. The methodology can be used as a baseline in other classification problems to provide several solutions and evaluate their performance using a set of representative metrics and decision-making methods. When several decision-making methods are used, they may offer disagreeing rankings that will be solved by conflict handling in which rankings are merged into a single one. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in this domain. Also, its general purpose allows to adapt it to other classification problems in different fields such as medicine and biology. © 2016, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

Often, these algorithms are used to optimize a single performance criterion.

abstract={Determining the optimal design of a watershed is a highly subjective process which involves the consideration of many distinct factors by several different stakeholder groups. We describe additional functionality for our watershed planning system, called WRESTORE (Watershed REstoration Using Spatio-Temporal Optimization of REsources) (http://wrestore.iupui.edu), where stakeholders can collaboratively optimize best management practices on to the watershed. WRESTORE utilizes the USDA's public domain Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrologic model for watershed simulations. Reinforcement learning and interactive genetic algorithms are applied for the search process. The new functionality described is a user modeling component that develops a computational model of a user's decision-making, based on real-time user-provided ratings for a subset of possible designs. The user modeling task utilizes neural network approaches, such as deep learning. We believe the originality of our approach centers on integrating user models in to the hydrological decision support process. This paper thus has three objectives: (i) outline current work in user modeling and watershed design, (ii) describe our system for interactive optimization of watershed design, and (iii) describe our work on implementing accurate and stable user predictive models to boost optimization performance. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Standard classifiers consider a balanced distribution of examples' classes in the data, thus, imbalanced datasets may hinder the learning process. Sampling techniques balance the data by adjusting the examples' classes distribution. However, selecting an appropriate sampling technique and its parameters for a given imbalanced dataset is still an open problem. This work proposes a method that uses Meta-Learning to recommend a technique for an imbalanced dataset considering multiple performance criteria. The experiments revealed that the proposal reached results comparable to those achieved by the brute-force approach, overcame the techniques with their default parameters most of the time, and always surpassed the random search approach. © ESANN 2017 - Proceedings, 25th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning.

abstract={114Any interruption in the electric service system could lead to major disruption of daily life and economic losses. Therefore, electric utility companies strive to maintain high customer service levels and try to make the best use of past power outage experiences. Increasing capabilities of analytics and improved accuracy of short-term weather forecasts present opportunities for electric utilities to leverage historic data to predict outages and proactively make decisions to minimize interruptions. As discussed in Chapter 3, analytics can be grouped into three types: descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. Electric utilities typically use descriptive analytics such as Pareto chart for descriptive statistics and data visualization to derive insights about most frequent cause of power interruptions. This chapter mainly focuses on predictive analytics that uses weather forecasts to predict power interruptions. In this chapter, prescriptive analytics is limited to formulating a multiple criteria mathematical programming model that minimizes staffing the cost and duration of power interruption. The objective of this chapter is to predict customer interruptions using historical data and hourly weather forecasts. Six different machine learning algorithms are evaluated and the best algorithm is chosen using multiple criteria ranking techniques to predict power interruptions. A case study using data of an electric utility covering 75 substations consisting of 19 fields and over 40,000 records collected over a 1-year period is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. Further, to illustrate the advantages of the prediction model, the prediction outputs are used as a key parameter to formulate a multicriteria mathematical programming model for workforce planning. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In this chapter, a two-stage decision support system is developed to enable banks in establishing an efficient loan portfolio that incorporates their strategic goals. Classification of customers into two levels of credit risk (high risk or low risk) is addressed in the first stage. Five different machine learning techniques (logistic regression, random forests, neural networks, gradient boosting, and stacking) are developed to classify the customers, and the best technique is selected using different performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. In the second stage, a multicriteria mathematical programming model is developed to obtain a diversified loan portfolio with the objective of achieving higher returns and lower risk.

abstract={Random forests are among the most popular classification and regression methods used in industrial applications. To be effective, the parameters of random forests must be carefully tuned. This is usually done by choosing values that minimize the prediction error on a held out dataset. We argue that error reduction is only one of several metrics that must be considered when optimizing random forest parameters for commercial applications. We propose a novel metric that captures the stability of random forest predictions, which we argue is key for scenarios that require successive predictions. We motivate the need for multi-criteria optimization by showing that in practical applications, simply choosing the parameters that lead to the lowest error can introduce unnecessary costs and produce predictions that are not stable across independent runs. To optimize this multi-criteria trade-off, we present a new framework that efficiently finds a principled balance between these three considerations using Bayesian optimisation. The pitfalls of optimising forest parameters purely for error reduction are demonstrated using two publicly available real world datasets. We show that our framework leads to parameter settings that are markedly different from the values discovered by error reduction metrics alone. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={A conceptual clustering is a set of formal concepts (i.e., closed itemsets) that defines a partition of a set of transactions. Finding a conceptual clustering is an NP -complete problem for which Constraint Programming (CP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approaches have been recently proposed. We introduce new CP models to solve this problem: a pure CP model that uses set constraints, and an hybrid model that uses a data mining tool to extract formal concepts in a preprocessing step and then uses CP to select a subset of formal concepts that defines a partition. We compare our new models with recent CP and ILP approaches on classical machine learning instances. We also introduce a new set of instances coming from a real application case, which aims at extracting setting concepts from an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. We consider two classic criteria to optimize, i.e., the frequency and the size. We show that these criteria lead to extreme solutions with either very few small formal concepts or many large formal concepts, and that compromise clusterings may be obtained by computing the Pareto front of non dominated clusterings. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Background: As the Internet becomes the number one destination for obtaining health-related information, there is an increasing need to identify health Web pages that convey an accurate and current view of medical knowledge. In response, the research community has created multicriteria instruments for reliably assessing online medical information quality. One such instrument is DISCERN, which measures health Web page quality by assessing an array of features. In order to scale up use of the instrument, there is interest in automating the quality evaluation process by building machine learning (ML)-based DISCERN Web page classiﬁers. Objective: The paper addresses 2 key issues that are essential before constructing automated DISCERN classiﬁers: (1) generation of a robust DISCERN training corpus useful for training classiﬁcation algorithms, and (2) assessment of the usefulness of the current DISCERN scoring schema as a metric for evaluating the performance of these algorithms. Methods: Using DISCERN, 272 Web pages discussing treatment options in breast cancer, arthritis, and depression were evaluated and rated by trained coders. First, different consensus models were compared to obtain a robust aggregated rating among the coders, suitable for a DISCERN ML training corpus. Second, a new DIS-CERN scoring criterion was proposed (features-based score) as an ML performance metric that is more reﬂective of the score distribution across different DISCERN quality criteria. Results: First, we found that a probabilistic consensus model applied to the DISCERN instrument was robust against noise (random ratings) and superior to other approaches for building a training corpus. Second, we found that the established DISCERN scoring schema (overall score) is ill-suited to measure ML performance for automated classiﬁers. Conclusion: Use of a probabilistic consensus model is advantageous for building a training corpus for the DISCERN instrument, and use of a features-based score is an appropriate ML metric for automated DISCERN classiﬁers. © The Author 2016.},

abstract={Vertical handover decision management is an essential to keep the seamless ubiquitous heterogeneous wireless networks since each access network has different operations in the next generation. In this paper, WCDMA, LTE and WLAN are cooperated in the architecture of mobile IP regional registration (MIP-RR). We propose the Learning Vector Quantization Neural Networks (LVQNNs) approach in order to maintain uninterrupted communication that depends on received signal strength indicator, data rate requirement, monetary cost of service and mobile terminal device speed metrics are considered as multi-criteria to initial handover. Furthermore, the multi-criteria are dynamic to influence for real-time and non-real time services in different networks and the users select the optimal target network which is the highest handover factor score in order to balance against the network condition and user preference. To ensure the Always Best Connected (ABC) demands, the simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithm provided outperform the performance in term of unnecessary handover, the call dropping probability, data packet delay and network utilization compared with conventional method as fuzzy logic and neural network based machine learning. © 2017 Int.

abstract={Complexity in solving real-world multicriteria optimization problems often stems from the fact that complex, expensive, and/or time-consuming simulation tools or physical experiments are used to evaluate solutions to a problem. In such settings, it is common to use efficient computational models, often known as surrogates or metamodels, to approximate the outcome (objective or constraint function value) of a simulation or physical experiment. The presence of multiple objective functions poses an additional layer of complexity for surrogate-assisted optimization. For example, complexities may relate to the appropriate selection of metamodels for the individual objective functions, extensive training time of surrogate models, or the optimal use of many-core computers to approximate efficiently multiple objectives simultaneously. Thinking out of the box, complexity can also be shifted from approximating the individual objective functions to approximating the entire Pareto front. This leads to further complexities, namely, how to validate statistically and apply the techniques developed to real-world problems. In this paper, we discuss emerging complexity-related topics in surrogate-assisted multicriteria optimization that may not be prevalent in nonsurrogate-assisted single-objective optimization. These complexities are motivated using several real-world problems in which the authors were involved. We then discuss several promising future research directions and prospective solutions to tackle emerging complexities in surrogate-assisted multicriteria optimization. Finally, we provide insights from an industrial point of view into how surrogate-assisted multicriteria optimization techniques can be developed and applied within a collaborative business environment to tackle real-world problems.

abstract={In Social Media, large amounts of User Generated Content (UGC) generally diffuse without any form of trusted external control. In this context, the risk of running into misinformation is not negligible. For this reason, assessing the credibility of both information and its sources in Social Media platforms constitutes nowadays a fundamental issue for users. In the last years, several approaches have been proposed to address this issue. Most of them employ machine learning techniques to classify information and misinformation. Other approaches exploit multiple kinds of relationships connecting entities in Social Media applications, focusing on credibility and trust propagation. Unlike previous approaches, in this paper we propose a model-driven approach based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and quantifier guided aggregation. An overall credibility estimate for each piece of information is obtained based on multiple criteria connected to both UGC and users generating it. The proposed model is evaluated in the context of opinion spam detection in review sites, on a real-world dataset crawled from Yelp, and it is compared with well-known supervised machine learning techniques. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={In decision making most approaches are taking into account objective criteria, however the subjective correlation among decision makers provided as preference utility is necessary to be presented to provide confidence preference additive among decision makers reducing ambiguity and produce better utility preferences measurement for subjective criteria among decision makers. Most models in Decision support systems are assuming criteria as independent. Therefore, these models are ranking alternatives based on objective data analysis. Also, different type of data (time series, linguistic values, interval data, etc.) imposes some difficulties to do decision making using classical multi criteria decision making models. Sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate or extract emotions from the content created by users has been developed including support vector machines, Bayesian networks, maximum entropy approaches and concept level analysis of natural language text, supported by combinations of common-sense reasoning. These approaches are mainly based on language text processing with sufficient documents, which is usually inlarge is not available. We think Subjectiveness is related to the contextual form of criteria. Uncertainty of some criteria in decision making is also considered as other important aspect These draw backs in decision making are major research challenges that are attracting wide attention, like on big data analysis for risk prediction, medical diagnosis and other applications that are in practice more subjective to user situation and its knowledge related context. Subjectivity would be examined based on correlations between different contextual structures that is reflecting the framework of personal context, for example in nearest neighbor based correlation analysis fashion. Some of the attributes incompleteness also may lead to affect the approximation accuracy. Attributes with preference-ordered domain relations properties become one aspect in ordering properties in rough approximations. The Virtual Doctor System (VDS) developed by my group is a system assisting human doctor who is practicing medical diagnosis in real situation and environment. The interoperability is represented by utilizing the medical diagnosis cases of medical doctor, represented in machine executable fashion based on human patient interaction with virtual avatar resembling a real doctor. VDS is practiced as a virtual avatar interacting with the human patient based on physical views and mental view analysis. In this talk I outline our VDS system and then discuss related issues in subjective decision making in medical domain. Using fuzzy reasoning techniques in VDS, it has been shown that it is possible to provide better precision in circumstances that is related to partial known data and uncertainty on the acquisition of medical symptoms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Kidney failure disease is being observed as a serious challenge to the medical field with its impact on a massive population of the world. Devoid of symptoms, kidney diseases are often identified too late when dialysis is needed urgently. Advanced data mining technologies can help provide alternatives to handle this situation by discovering hidden patterns and relationships in medical data. The objective of this research work is to predict kidney disease by using multiple machine learning algorithms that are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (C4.5), Bayesian Network (BN) and K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN). The aim of this work is to compare those algorithms and define the most efficient one(s) on the basis of multiple criteria. The database used is “Chronic Kidney Disease” implemented on the WEKA platform. From the experimental results, it is observed that MLP and C4.5 have the best rates. However, when compared with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, C4.5 appears to be the most efficient. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.},

abstract={Data clustering is a very well studied problem in machine learning, data mining, and related disciplines. Most of the existing clustering methods have focused on optimizing a single clustering objective. Often, several recent disciplines such as robot team deployment, ad hoc networks, multi-agent systems, facility location, etc., need to consider multiple criteria, often conflicting, during clustering. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a sequential game theoretic approach for multi-objective clustering, called ClusSMOG-II. It is specially designed to optimize simultaneously intrinsically conflicting objectives, which are inter-cluster/intra-cluster inertia and connectivity. This technique has an advantage of keeping the number of clusters dynamic. The approach consists of three main steps. The first step sets initial clusters with their representatives, whereas the second step calculates the correct number of clusters by resolving a sequence of multi-objective multi-act sequential two-player games for conflict-clusters. Finally, the third step constructs homogenous clusters by resolving sequential two-player game between each cluster representative and the representative of its nearest neighbor. For each game, we define payoff functions that correspond to the model objectives. We use a methodology based on backward induction to calculate a pure Nash equilibrium for each game. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Terrain conditions, stand structure attributes, and environmental factors are important elements that determine the success of timber harvests. Planning designs for timber harvesting projects must also be physically feasible, environmentally acceptable, and economically viable and address potentially competing objectives upfront in a multi-purpose planning effort. Under mountainous conditions involving highly variable and steep terrain, harvest planning is a particularly complex decision-making process. Here, quantitative (objective) information (e.g., stand volume) is jointly considered with qualitative (subjective) information (e.g., expert judgment of slope failure event and preference value of a certain stand) to arrive at a compromise plan that considers conflicting management objectives. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the existing terrain conditions of a large management area to find zones in which harvest operations can be conducted, assess which portions of the terrain can be harvested by different equipment that is available in the region, and locate landing sites for ground-based skidding operations. The criteria used in this study included quantitative and qualitative elements that were measured/evaluated across different scales. To address this complex decision-making process, we used an integrative approach that combined spatial analyses with multiple-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). Existing geospatial data were combined with information obtained through pairwise evaluations of environmental, topographic, and stand structure elements to create maps in which the terrain was divided into zones of different suitability classes for timber harvests, placement of landing sites, and deployment of different harvesting systems. The results and assessment of this case study indicate that the methodology has great potential for a more integrated policy, in particular, where multiple spatial objectives explicitly need to be taken into consideration when solving complex forest-management problems in mountainous conditions. One key finding from this work that needs to be further explored involves efficient ways of incorporating this methodology into traditional harvest scheduling models to better support the operational and tactical phases of the timber harvesting. © 2016},

abstract={Opportunistic networking is at the basis of cyber-physical Mobile Networks in Proximity (MNP), through its unique perspective over mobility and the incorporation of socio-inspired networking algorithms. However, results in the field are mostly theoretical, proven to account for stricter hit rate and latency requirements in specific environments. They generally assume that two devices being in proximity automatically see one-another, an assumption which might not stand under real-world conditions (Bluetooth assumes a peering session and close-proximity, WiFi Direct implementations are different between manufacturers, etc.). Our previous studies in the area show that WiFi is still the most feasible media for opportunistic contacts. WiFi-enabled devices, with out-of-the-box networking capabilities, can connect in an ad-hoc opportunistic network, over wireless routers, and thus support a cyber-physical infrastructure for opportunistically spreading information. In this article, we propose a machine learning algorithm that aims to increase the number of contacts between mobile nodes by using a smarter WiFi access point selection heuristic. The algorithm is based on properly balancing signal strength, latency, bandwidth, and, most importantly, the number of friends predicted to connect to the respective access point. We show through simulations based on real-life tracing data-sets that our proposed solution not only increases the likelihood of opportunistic contacts, but it also evenly distributes social subgraphs of users over wireless networks while improving the overall hit rate. © 2016},

abstract={Several global gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) remote sensing products exist, mainly provided by machine-learning (e.g. MPI-BGC) and semi-empirical (e.g. MODIS) approaches. Process-based approaches have the advantage of representing the atmosphere-vegetation-soil system and associated fluxes as an organic integration, but their sophistication results in a lack of high spatiotemporal resolution continuous products. Targeting this gap, we reported a new set of global 8-day composite 1-km resolution GPP and ET products from 2000 to 2015, using a simplified process-based model, the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). BESS couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer, photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and uses MODIS atmosphere and land data and other satellite data sources as inputs. We evaluated BESS products against FLUXNET observations at site scale (total of 113 sites, 742 site years), and against MPI-BGC products at global scale. At site scale, BESS 8-day products agreed with FLUXNET observations with R2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 2.58 gC m− 2 d− 1 for GPP, and R2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 0.78 mm d− 1 for ET, respectively, and they captured a majority of seasonal variability, about half of spatial variability, and a minority of interannual variability in FLUXNET observations. At global scale, BESS mean annual sum GPP and ET maps agreed with MPI-BGC products with R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 229 gC m− 2 y− 1 for GPP, and R2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 118 mm y− 1 for ET, respectively. Over the period of 2001–2011, BESS quantified the mean global GPP and ET as 122 ± 25 PgC y− 1 and 65 × 103 ± 11 × 103 km3 y− 1, respectively, with a significant ascending GPP trend by 0.27 PgC y− 2 (p &lt; 0.05), similar to MPI-BGC products as well. Overall, BESS GPP and ET estimates were comparable with FLUXNET observations and MPI-BGC products. The process-based BESS can serve as a set of independent GPP and ET products from official MODIS GPP and ET products. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to develop a hybrid methodology that integrates machine learning algorithms with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques to effectively conduct multi-attribute inventory analysis. In the proposed methodology, first, ABC analyses using three different MCDM methods (i.e. simple-additive weighting, analytical hierarchy process, and VIKOR) are employed to determine the appropriate class for each of the inventory items. Following this, naïve Bayes, Bayesian network, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are implemented to predict classes of initially determined stock items. Finally, the detailed prediction performance metrics of algorithms for each method are determined. The comprehensive case study executed at a large-scale automotive company revealed that the best classification accuracy is achieved by SVMs. The results also revealed that Bayesian networks, SVMs and ANNs are all capable of successfully dealing with the unbalanced data problems associated with Pareto distribution, and each of these algorithms performed well against all examined measures, thus validating the fact that machine learning algorithms are highly applicable to inventory classification problems. Therefore, this study presents uniqueness in that it is the first and foremost of its kind to effectively combine MCDM methods with machine learning algorithms in multi-attribute inventory classification and is practically applicable in various inventory settings. Furthermore, this study also provides a comprehensive chronological overview of the existing literature of machine learning methods within inventory classification problems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and detection error tradeoff (DET) curves are frequently used in the machine learning community to analyze the performance of binary classifiers. Recently, the convex-hull-based multiobjective genetic programming algorithm was proposed and successfully applied to maximize the convex hull area for binary classification problems by minimizing false positive rate and maximizing true positive rate at the same time using indicator-based evolutionary algorithms. The area under the ROC curve was used for the performance assessment and to guide the search. Here we extend this research and propose two major advancements: Firstly we formulate the algorithm in detection error tradeoff space, minimizing false positives and false negatives, with the advantage that misclassification cost tradeoff can be assessed directly. Secondly, we add complexity as an objective function, which gives rise to a 3D objective space (as opposed to a 2D previous ROC space). A domain specific performance indicator for 3D Pareto front approximations, the volume above DET surface, is introduced, and used to guide the indicator-based evolutionary algorithm to find optimal approximation sets. We assess the performance of the new algorithm on designed theoretical problems with different geometries of Pareto fronts and DET surfaces, and two application-oriented benchmarks: (1) Designing spam filters with low numbers of false rejects, false accepts, and low computational cost using rule ensembles, and (2) finding sparse neural networks for binary classification of test data from the UCI machine learning benchmark. The results show a high performance of the new algorithm as compared to conventional methods for multicriteria optimization. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Traditional units of genome-wide association studies have serious defects such as low repeatability, difficulty to interpret, and epistasis analysis based on machine learning has troubles such as high computational complexity and insufficient prediction accuracy. This paper presented a new approach for the analysis of genome-wide epistatic. This method uses the framework of two-phase epistatic analysis method. It includes a filtering stage and an epistatic combinatorial optimization stage. The characteristics of the filtering stage presents a multicriteria fusion strategy for the evaluation of genetic loci from multiple perspectives to ensure that the weak effect of susceptibility loci can be retained, and then, this method uses the multiple criteria sorting fusion strategy to eliminate the low degree of genetic variation associated with disease states. Epistatic combinatorial optimization phase uses the greedy algorithm combination of heuristic search space in order to reduce the time complexity. Finally, a support vector machine was used as the epistatic evaluation model. Experiments with different parameters of linkage disequilibrium SNPruler with classical algorithms were compared with the performance of the ACO, and the experiment results show that the method can effectively keep weak effect locus and improve disease forecasting accuracy considerably. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Hunan University.

abstract={Background and objective: The principal challenges in the field of anesthesia and intensive care consist of reducing both anesthetic risks and mortality rate. The ASA score plays an important role in patients' preanesthetic evaluation. In this paper, we propose a methodology to derive simple rules which classify patients in a category of the ASA scale on the basis of their medical characteristics. Methods: This diagnosis system is based on MR-Sort, a multiple criteria decision analysis model. The proposed method intends to support two steps in this process. The first is the assignment of an ASA score to the patient; the second concerns the decision to accept-or not-the patient for surgery. Results: In order to learn the model parameters and assess its effectiveness, we use a database containing the parameters of 898 patients who underwent preanesthesia evaluation. The accuracy of the learned models for predicting the ASA score and the decision of accepting the patient for surgery is assessed and proves to be better than that of other machine learning methods. Furthermore, simple decision rules can be explicitly derived from the learned model. These are easily interpretable by doctors, and their consistency with medical knowledge can be checked. Conclusions: The proposed model for assessing the ASA score produces accurate predictions on the basis of the (limited) set of patient attributes in the database available for the tests. Moreover, the learned MR-Sort model allows for easy interpretation by providing human-readable classification rules. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Many organizations recognize the necessities of utilizing sophisticated tools and systems to protect their computer networks and reduce the risk of compromising their information. Although many machine-learning-based data classification algorithm has been proposed in network intrusion detection problem, each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose an effective intrusion detection framework by using a new adaptive, robust, precise optimization method, namely, time-varying chaos particle swarm optimization (TVCPSO) to simultaneously do parameter setting and feature selection for multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and support vector machine (SVM). In the proposed methods, a weighted objective function is provided, which takes into account trade-off between the maximizing the detection rate and minimizing the false alarm rate, along with considering the number of features. Furthermore, to make the particle swarm optimization algorithm faster in searching the optimum and avoid the search being trapped in local optimum, chaotic concept is adopted in PSO and time varying inertia weight and time varying acceleration coefficient is introduced. The performance of proposed methods has been evaluated by conducting experiments with the NSL-KDD dataset, which is derived and modified from well-known KDD cup 99 data sets. The empirical results show that the proposed method performs better in terms of having a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate when compared with the obtained results using all features. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Machine learning algorithms known for their performance in using historical data and examples to predict and classify unknown instances. Decision tree is an efficient machine learning approach that can use data only without the involvement of decision maker to improve the decision making process. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)is another paradigm used for data classification. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy classification method based on MCDA called PROAFTN. To use PROAFTN, a set of parameters need to be established from data. The proposed approach uses data pre-processing and canonical genetic algorithm (GA) for obtaining these parameters from data. The generated models have been applied on popular data selected from several application domain, health, economy, etc. According to our experimental study, the new model performs significantly better than decision trees according in terms of accuracy and the interpretation of the decision rules. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We describe a "multistep reaction driven" evolutionary algorithm approach to de novo molecular design. Structures generated by the approach include a proposed synthesis path intended to aid the chemist in assessing the synthetic feasibility of the ideas that are generated. The methodology is independent of how the design ideas are scored, allowing multicriteria drug design to address multiple issues including activity at one or more pharmacological targets, selectivity, physical and ADME properties, and off target liabilities; the methods are compatible with common computer-aided drug discovery "scoring" methodologies such as 2D- and 3D-ligand similarity, docking, desirability functions based on physiochemical properties, and/or predictions from 2D/3D QSAR or machine learning models and combinations thereof to be used to guide design. We have performed experiments to assess the extent to which known drug space can be covered by our approach. Using a library of 88 generic reactions and a database of ∼20 000 reactants, we find that our methods can identify "close" analogs for ∼50% of the known small molecule drugs with molecular weight less than 300. To assess the quality of the in silico generated synthetic pathways, synthesis chemists were asked to rate the viability of synthesis pathways: both "real" and in silico generated. In silico reaction schemes generated by our methods were rated as very plausible with scores similar to known literature synthesis schemes. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Assessment of skeletal maturation is important for the accurate diagnosis and medical treatment of many disorders and syndromes. However, determining skeletal maturation is not a trivial task, and requires professional medical training. The aim of this paper is to review the application of classification techniques to the problem of identifying the skeletal maturation stage of individuals, in order to provide the specialists a second opinion to backup or reject their assessments. A methodology based on Rough Sets is developed, which formulates skeletal maturation as a multicriteria classification problem, and generates classification rules employing data from lateral radiographs. Our methodology introduces the concept of transition maturity stages to obtain a finer classification on the data. Our empirical evaluation shows that the rules generated match the terms used by experts to determine maturation stage. Furthermore, our rough sets methodology produces the best results in our case of study, both in terms of coverage on the data and accuracy of the classification process, with respect to alternative classification approaches. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Feature selection plays an important role in pattern recognition and machine learning. Confronted with high dimensional data in many data analysis tasks, feature selection techniques are designed to find a relevant feature subset of the original features which can facilitate classification. However, in many real-world applications, missing feature values that contribute to test and misclassification costs are emerging to be an issue of increasing concern for most data sets, particularly dealing with big data. The existing feature selection approaches do not address this issue effectively. In this paper, based on rough set theory we address the problem of feature selection for cost-sensitive data with missing values. We first propose a multi-criteria evaluation function to characterize the significance of candidate features, by taking into consideration not only the power in the positive region and boundary region but also their associated costs. On this basis, we develop a forward greedy feature selection algorithm for selecting a feature subset of minimized cost that preserves the same information as the whole feature set. In addition, to improve the efficiency of this algorithm, we implement the selection of candidate features in a dwindling object set. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm to the existing feature selection algorithms through experimental results on different data sets. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A proactive mechanism to learn an efficient strategy for adaptive resource clusters is proposed. In contrast to reactive techniques, that rescale the cluster to fit the past load, a predictive strategy is adopted. The cluster incoming workload is forecasted and an optimization problem is defined whose solution is the optimal action according to a utility function. Genetic-based machine learning techniques are used, including multi-objective evolutionary algorithms under the distal supervised learning setup. Experimental evaluations show that the proactive system presented in this work improves either the energetic efficiency or the number of reconfigurations of previous approaches without a loss in the quality of service. Depending on the predictability of the workload, in real world cluster scenarios additional energy savings of up to approximately 40% were measured over the best previous approach, with a 2× factor increment in the number of reconfigurations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In supervised learning scenarios there are different existing methods for solving a task of feature selection for automatic speaker state analysis; many of them achieved reasonable results. Feature selection in unsupervised learning scenarios is a more complicated problem, due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. Supervised feature selection methods are "wrapper" techniques that require a learning algorithm to evaluate the candidate feature subsets; unsupervised feature selection methods are "filters" which are independent of any learning algorithm. However, they are usually performed separately from each other. In this paper, we propose a method which can be performed in supervised and unsupervised forms simultaneously based on multi-criteria evolutionary procedure which consists of two stages: self-adjusting multi-criteria genetic algorithm and self-adjusting multi-criteria genetic programming. The proposed approach was compared with different methods for feature selection on four audio corpora for speaker emotion recognition and for speaker gender identification. The obtained results showed that the developed technique provides to increase emotion recognition performance by up to 46.5% and by up to 20.5% for the gender identification task in terms of accuracy. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={Recommender systems are software tools that have been widely used to recommend valuable items to users. They have the capacity to support and enhance the quality of decisions people make when finding and selecting items online. Such systems work based on which techniques are used to estimate users' preferences on potentially new items that might be useful to them. Traditionally, the most common techniques used by many existing recommendation systems are collaborative filtering, content-based, knowledge-based and a hybrid-based which combines two or more techniques in different ways. The multi-criteria recommendation technique is a new technique used to recommend items to users based on ratings given to multiple attributes of items. This technique has been used and proven by researchers in industries and academic institutions to provide more accurate predictions than traditional techniques. However, what is still not yet clear is the role of some machine learning algorithms such as the artificial neural network to improve its prediction accuracy. This paper proposed using a feedforward neural network to model user preferences in multi-criteria recommender systems. The operational results of experiments for training and testing the network using two training algorithms and Yahoo!Movie dataset are also presented.},

abstract={In many research and development fields, the stakeholders faced dilemma to acquire the accurate multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) outcomes. Observations showed that the inaccuracy of MCDM outcomes might be due to the missing of the right context for decision making process. This research is motivated to propose a contextualization approach for better critical issues' decision making support. The proposed triad-based contextualisation approach comprises three (3) processes namely the context characterisation, context representation, and context interpretation. At the end of a contextualisation process cycle, a set of consistent triad relationships would be derived to represent the current context of a critical issue. The context could be served as the right objective for guiding any critical issue's MCDM process. Experiment showed that the consistency of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) outcome has been improved when the stakeholder used the proposed contextualization approach to depict the the right context as the objective for decision making deliberations. It is believed that once the proposed approach is conducted in many contextualisation process cycles with the help of machine learning systems and advance analytics tools in the future, it could produce a useful set of contexts or objectives for better critical issues' decision making insights. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

The important milestones of these new paradigms are known as digital learning objects (DLO) which are smallest packed bits for learning. The abundance of these DLOs raises an important question on how to select effectively high quality reusable learning objects. There exist many soft computing approaches such as; fuzzy computing, neural networks, evolutionary computing, support vector machines, machine learning and probabilistic reasoning. In this paper, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods in choosing suitable DLOs were reviewed. This paper discusses recent variety of soft computing methods used in selecting and evaluating digital learning objects through multi criteria decision analysis approaches used; for selecting metrics like basic topical, course similarity, internal topical, basic and user similarity personal, and context similarity situational relevance and for evaluation; scalarization method, employing triangular, trapezoidal and distance based similarity (adapted from TOPSIS techniques). As DLOs continue to evolve it is inevitable to utilize multi-criteria techniques for selecting and or improving quality. The abundance of DLOs has increased the need for applying practical soft computing techniques to retrieve high quality, reusable DLOs. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Choosing the appropriate forecasting technique to employ is a challenging issue and requires a comprehensive analysis of empirical results. Recent research findings reveal that the performance evaluation of forecasting models depends on the accuracy measures adopted. Some methods indicate superior performance when error based metrics are used, while others perform better when precision values are adopted as accuracy measures. As scholars tend to use a smaller subset of accuracy metrics to assess the performance of forecasting models, there is a need for a concept of multiple accuracy dimensions to assure the robustness of evaluation. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to propose a decision making model that allows researchers to identify the superiority of a forecasting technique over another by considering several accuracy metrics concurrently. A multi-criteria decision analysis approach, namely the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE), was adopted to solve this problem. Bayesian Networks, Artificial Neural Networks, SVMs, Logistic Regression, and several Rule and Tree-based forecasting approaches were included in the analysis. After introducing a detailed description of accuracy measures, the performance of the prediction models are evaluated using a chosen dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Designing systems that can detect irregularities in process monitoring data and which can be implemented efficiently is a challenge. The ability to detect and diagnose such events will help ensure stability of operations, avoiding excursions that cross thresholds reflecting safe operating limits and consequently improving process reliability and availability. Typically, using classical outlier techniques to detect anomalies assumes that a 'normal' pattern of behavior, in a statistical sense, can be assumed and/or confirmed and used to identify what is an extreme observation. In practice, simple univariate measures of normality seldom result in effective solutions in systems whose dynamic behavior generates wide-ranging time varying data. This paper presents a multi-criteria, data-driven approach for detecting irregularities in multivariate, time-series, dynamic systems with irregular changing patterns. The capability to automatically detect and flag such data will reduce the risk of crossing operational boundaries and improve levels of operations availability. We developed a semi-supervised machine learning framework that provides a blue print for configuring application-specific irregularity detection. The framework takes into account the extreme dynamics typically encountered in Upstream operations that limit standard learning models' capabilities to accurately represent and hence draw inferences about the state of the underlying system. A hybrid, adaptive, non-linear, probabilistic, reasoning model learns iteratively over multiple operating windows to identify breakouts in typical behavior and to detect 'remarkable' divergence of reconstructed signal from original space. The method can identify single or multiple instances of irregular activity, since the underlying causal factors, resulting in such behavior, are likely to generate a number of irregularities reflecting nonconformity to normal pattern. Unexpected sequential changes in observed system behavior can be leveraged as a firstlevel filter of the basic anomaly signature. Results show that applying the framework to detecting irregularity in wells operations enabled near real-time flagging of irregular patterns. An operator's adjustable alert can be set based on a threshold value of the calculated score of the streaming signal. This new approach is a significant departure from conventional methods of establishing and using baselines for normal process behavior, such as signature-based, profiling, fingerprinting, etc., to detect anomalies. Its key advantage is that it avoids the use of single-valued thresholds intrinsic to the competing methods of the types listed above. Such single-valued thresholds have the effect of limiting the practical application of such techniques in Oil and Gas applications. Copyright 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

abstract={The US EPA’s ToxCast program is screening thousands of chemicals of environmental interest in hundreds of in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. One goal is to prioritize chemicals for more detailed analyses based on activity in assays that target molecular initiating events (MIEs) of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). However, the chemical space of interest for environmental exposure is much wider than ToxCast’s chemical library. In silico methods such as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) are proven and cost-effective approaches to predict biological activity for untested chemicals. However, empirical data is needed to build and validate QSARs. ToxCast has developed datasets for about 2000 chemicals ideal for training and testing QSAR models. The overall goal of the present work was to develop QSAR models to fill the data gaps in larger environmental chemical lists. The specific aim of the current work was to build QSAR models for 18 G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) assays, part of the aminergic family. Two QSAR modeling strategies were adopted: classification models were developed to separate chemicals into active/non-active classes, and then regression models were built to predict the potency values of the bioassays for the active chemicals. Multiple software programs were used to calculate constitutional, topological, and substructural molecular descriptors from two-dimensional (2D) chemical structures. Model-fitting methods included PLSDA (partial least square discriminant analysis), SVMs (support vector machines), kNNs (k-nearest neighbors), and PLSs (partial least squares). Genetic algorithms (GAs) were applied as a variable selection technique to select the most predictive molecular descriptors for each assay. N-fold cross-validation (CV) coupled with multi-criteria decision-making fitting criteria was used to evaluate the models. Finally, the models were applied to make predictions within the established chemical space limits. The most accurate model was for the bovine nonselective dopamine receptor (bDR_NS) GPCR assay, for which the classification balanced accuracy reached 0.96 in fitting and 0.95 in fivefold CV, with only two latent variables. These results demonstrate the accuracy of QSAR models to predict the biological activity of chemicals specifically for each one of the studied assays. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.},

In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) techniques to perform inventory classifications. Five ML techniques are utilized to reduce the class imbalance produced by six multi-criteria inventory classification techniques. An empirical investigation is conducted using a classical benchmark inventory data. The effectiveness of these ML techniques is assessed through three criteria: class distribution, accuracy and total inventory cost. We show the reduction of class imbalance in the classification provided by ML techniques, as well as high performance accuracy and lower inventory cost whilst still achieving the specified class distribution constraint.},

abstract={Classifier ensembles appeared to be powerful alternative for handling a difficult problem. It is rapidly growing and enjoying many attentions from pattern recognition and machine learning communities. In the present report, the potential of multi-criteria decision making via multiclassifier approaches is assessed by applying them in the modeling of chemicals against hyper-pigmentation. TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as descriptors to parameterize the molecular structures. Support vector machine, artificial neural network, Bayesian network, binary logistic regression, instance-based learning and tree classification applied on two collected datasets are explored as standalone classifiers. Prediction sets (PSs) are used to assess the performance of multiclassifier systems (MCSs). A strategy exploiting the principal component analysis together with pairwise diversity measures is designed to select the most diverse base classifiers to combine. Various trainable and nontrainable systems are developed that aggregate, at the abstract and continuous levels, the outputs of base classifiers. The obtained results are rather encouraging since the MCSs generally enhance the performance of the base classifiers; e.g. the best MCS obtains global accuracy of 95.51%, 88.89% in the PS for the data I and II in regard to 94.12% and 85.93% of best individual classifier, respectively. Our results suggest that the MCSs could be the best choice till the moment to obtain suitable QSAR models for the prediction of depigmenting agents. Finally, we consider these approaches will aid improving the virtual screening procedures and increasing the practicality of data mining of chemical datasets for the discovery of novel lead compounds. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.},

As the training information, our method requires the pairwise preferences of alternatives, as revealed by the DM. Once, the DM's decision model is learnt in terms of the criteria weights, it can be applied to predict his choices for any new set of alternatives. The empirical validation of the proposed approach is done on a collection of 12 standard datasets.

This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hierarchical fuzzy aggregation network (HFAN) is a fine multilayer information fusion system that carries out multi-criteria aggregation. It can be regarded as a functional classifier for dealing with decision-making problems. The HFAN comprises fuzzy aggregation operators built from adjusted parameters (γ) and associated weights (δ). In this paper, we adopt soft computing techniques (e.g., PSO and SSO) to learn these fuzzy aggregation operators. We provide association rules to define input data and use a hierarchical clustering algorithm to organize the network structure. The optimization efficiency of these rules is experimented with different network topologies and datasets. We verify effectiveness of HFAN by applying it to classify the breast cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We conduct study for comparing the optimized HFAN and other approaches in terms of ten-fold cross-validation. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Until now, few research has addressed the use of machine learning methods for classification at the sub-pixel level. To close this knowledge gap, in this article, six machine learning methods were compared for the specific task of sub-pixel land-cover extraction in the spatially heterogeneous region of Flanders (Belgium). In addition to the classification accuracy at the pixel and the municipality level, three evaluation criteria reflecting the methods’ ease-of-use were added to the comparison: the time needed for training, the number of meta-parameters, and the minimum training set size. Robustness to changing training data was also included as the sixth evaluation criterion. Based on their scores for these six criteria, the machine learning methods were ranked according to three multi-criteria ranking scenarios. These ranking scenarios correspond to different decision-making scenarios that differ in their weighting of the criteria. In general, no overall winner could be designated: no method performs best for all evaluation scenarios. However, when both time available for preprocessing and the magnitude of the training data set are unconstrained, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) clearly outperform the other methods. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Multi-criteria decision making problem has been well studied for many years. One popular query for multi-criteria decision making is top-k queries which require each user to specify an exact utility function. In many cases, the utility function of a user is probabilistic and finding the distribution on the utility functions has been widely explored in the machine learning areas, such as user's recommender systems, Bayesian learning models and user's preference elicitation, for improving user's experience. Motivated by this, we propose a new type of queries called k-hit queries, which has not been studied before. Given a set D of tuples in the database, the distribution Θ on utility functions and a positive integer k, we would like to select a set of k tuples from D in order to maximize the probability that at least one of tuples in the selection set is the favorite of a user. All applications for top-k queries can naturally be used in k-hit queries. In this paper, we present various interesting properties of k-hit queries. Besides, based on these properties, we propose a novel algorithm called k-hit-Alg for k-hit queries. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments to show that the performance of our proposed method, k-hit-Alg, is superior compared with other existing algorithms which were originally used to answer other existing queries.

abstract={Because of the current shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources, it is necessary to plan for the installation of new infrastructure to meet the demand for clean energy. Traditional methods for determining wind turbine site suitability suffer from the selection of arbitrary criteria and model parameters by experts, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty in the models produced. An alternative empirically based methodology for building a wind turbine siting model for the state of Iowa is presented in the study. We employ 'ecological niche' principles traditionally utilized to model species allocation to develop a new multicriteria, spatially explicit framework for wind turbine placement. Using information on suitability conditions at existing turbine locations, we incorporate seven variables (wind speed, elevation, slope, land cover, distance of infrastructure and settlements, and population density) into two machine-learning algorithms [maximum entropy method (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction (GARP)] to model suitable areas for installation of wind turbines. The performance of this method is tested at the statewide level and a six-county region in western Iowa. Maxent and GARP identified areas in the Northwest and North Central regions of Iowa as the optimum location for new wind turbines. Information on variable contributions from Maxent illuminates the relative importance of environmental variables and its scale-dependent nature. It also allows validating existing assumptions about the relationship between variables and wind turbine suitability. The resultant models demonstrate high levels of accuracy and suggest that the presented approach is a possible methodology for developing wind turbine siting applications.

The criteria included are: predictive model accuracy, model complexity, and algorithmic complexity (related to the learning/adaptation algorithm and prediction delivery) captured by monitoring the execution time. Furthermore, it compares the models generated from optimising the criteria using two approaches. The first approach is a scalarized multi objective optimisation, where the models are generated from optimising a single cost function that combines the criteria. On the other hand the second approach uses a Pareto-based multi objective optimisation to trade-off the three criteria and to generate a set of non-dominated models. This study shows that defining universal measures for the three criteria is not always feasible. Furthermore, it was shown that, the models generated from Pareto-based multi objective optimisation approach can be more accurate and more diverse than the models generated from scalarized multi objective optimisation approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent research revealed that model-assisted parameter tuning can improve the quality of supervised machine learning (ML) models. The tuned models were especially found to generalize better and to be more robust compared to other optimization approaches. However, the advantages of the tuning often came along with high computation times, meaning a real burden for employing tuning algorithms. While the training with a reduced number of patterns can be a solution to this, it is often connected with decreasing model accuracies and increasing instabilities and noise. Hence, we propose a novel approach defined by a two criteria optimization task, where both the runtime and the quality of ML models are optimized. Because the budgets for this optimization task are usually very restricted in ML, the surrogate-assisted Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm is adapted. In order to cope with noisy experiments, we apply two hypervolume indicator based EGO algorithms with smoothing and re-interpolation of the surrogate models. The techniques do not need replicates. We find that these EGO techniques can outperform traditional approaches such as latin hypercube sampling (LHS), as well as EGO variants with replicates. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to present a Total Power Quality Index (TPQI) for estimating Power Quality (PQ) at a specific site of the electric network using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology techniques and a variety of methods from Machine Learning. The main advantage of this methodology is the avoidance of certain arbitrary parameters used in previous research efforts implementing a Fuzzy Index Model. For the purposes of this study and for the training process of the proposed ANN model additional data derived from Power Quality measurements along with an appropriate questionnaire which gathered the opinion of experts was used. The proposed methodology appeared to be flexible, reprogrammable with the capability to assimilate new measurements and estimations in any specific case study. The outcome of the proposed ANN model is compared with the corresponding previously introduced Fuzzy Index model over three different case studies, providing significant results for further improvement. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Three different approaches for evaluation of the research impact by a scientist are considered. Two of them are conventional ones, scoring the impact over (a) citation metrics and (b) merit metrics. The third one relates to the level of results. It involves a taxonomy of the research field, that is, a hierarchy representing its composition. The impact is evaluated according to the taxonomy ranks of the subjects that have emerged or have been crucially transformed due to the results by the scientist under consideration Mirkin (Control Large Syst Spec Issue 44:292– 307, 2013). To aggregate criteria in approaches (a) and (b) we use an in-house automated criteria weighting method oriented towards as tight a representation of the strata as possible Orlov (Bus Inf, 2014). To compare the approaches empirically, we use publicly available data of about 30 scientists in the areas of data analysis and machine learning. As our taxonomy of the field, we invoke a corresponding part of the ACM Computing Classification System 2012 and slightly modify it to better reflect results by the scientists in our sample. The obtained ABC stratifications are rather far each other. This supports the view that all the three approaches (citations, merits, taxonomic rank) should be considered as different aspects, and, therefore, a good method for scoring research impact should involve all the three. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are increasingly becoming popular for dealing with optimization problems with more than three objectives, commonly termed as many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). These algorithms elicit preferences from a single or multiple Decision Makers (DMs), a priori or interactively, to guide the search towards the solutions most preferred by the DM(s), as against the whole Pareto-optimal Front (POF). Despite its promise for dealing with MaOPs, the utility of this approach is impaired by the lack of- objectivity; repeatability; consistency; and coherence in DM's preferences. This paper proposes a machine learning based framework to counter the above limitations. Towards it, the preference-structure of the different objectives embedded in the problem model is learnt in terms of: a smallest set of conflicting objectives which can generate the same POF as the original problem; the smallest objective sets corresponding to pre-specified errors; and the objective sets of pre-specified sizes that correspond to minimum error. While the focus is on demonstrating how the proposed framework could serve as a decision support for the DM, its performance is also studied vis-à-vis an alternative approach (based on dominance relation preservation), for a wide range of test problems and a real-world problem. The results mark a new direction for MCDM based MOEAs for MaOPs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={One of the most challenging tasks in data mining is to choose a better classifier for classification problems as this involves multiple criteria. The multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques are noteworthy to judge different alternatives on various criteria. In this paper, a simplified MCDM technique is applied to make a judgement on different alternatives (classifiers) among multiple criteria in financial risk datasets. For this purpose, the paired t-test statistical significance test and significant win-loss tables are used to determine the performance scores for each classifier. Then, the weights are determined using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and finally simplified MCDM weighted sum model is applied to rank the classifiers. In addition, the efficiency of this simplified MCDM method is compared with other top MCDM methods such as TOPSIS, PROMETHEE and VIKOR to evaluate if there are any discrepancies in ranking. Analysis has been done for the three financial risk datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and surprisingly this simplified approach and the other top MCDM methods produce consistent rankings. Logistic regression and Bayesnet are ranked as the top two classifiers for financial risk datasets by this simplified approach and the other top MCDM methods. The simplified MCDM model can be applied to rank the classifiers which use simplified backgrounds in making right decisions among multiple criteria. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Naturally occurring data have been growing in a huge volume size, which poses a big challenge to give them high-quality labels to learn a good model. Therefore, it is critical to only select the most informative data points for labeling, which is cast into the framework of active learning. We study this problem in a regression model from optimal experimental design (OED). To this end, several OED based methods have been developed, but the relations between the data points and their predictions are still not fully explored. Inspired by this, we employ the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) to maximize the dependence between the samples and their estimations in a global view. Thus, we present a novel active learning method named manifold optimal experimental design via dependence maximization (MODM). Specifically, those points having maximum dependence with their predictions are expected to be included for labeling. Besides, it utilizes the graph Laplacian to preserve the locally geometrical structure of the data. In this way, the most informative data points can be better selected. Moreover, we adopt a sequential strategy to optimize the objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been experimentally verified in content-based image retrieval. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: BioTextRetriever is a Web-based search tool for retrieving relevant literature in Molecular Biology and related domains from MEDLINE. The core of BioTextRetriever is the dynamic construction of a classifier capable of selecting relevant papers among the whole MEDLINE bibliographic database. “Relevant” papers, in this context, means papers related to a set of DNA or protein sequences provided as input to the tool by the user. Methods: Since the number of retrieved papers may be very large, BioTextRetriever uses a novel ranking algorithm to retrieve the most relevant papers first. We have developed a new methodology that enables the automation of the assessment process based on a multi-criteria ranking function. This function combines six factors: MeSH terms, paper’s number of citations, author’s h-index, journals impact factor, author number of publications and journal similarity function. Results: The best results highlight the number of citations and the h-index factors. Conclusions: We have developed and a multi-criteria ranking function, that contemplates six factors, and that seems appropriate to retrieve relevant papers out of a huge repository such as MEDLINE. © 2014, Gonçalves et al.; licensee Springer.},

abstract={Watershed management decisions need robust methods, which allow an accurate predictive modeling of pollutant occurrences. Random Forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning data driven method that is rarely used in water resources studies, and thus has not been evaluated thoroughly in this field, when compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques key advantages of RF include: its non-parametric nature; high predictive accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. This last characteristic can be used to better understand the individual role and the combined effect of explanatory variables in both protecting and exposing groundwater from and to a pollutant.In this paper, the performance of the RF regression for predictive modeling of nitrate pollution is explored, based on intrinsic and specific vulnerability assessment of the Vega de Granada aquifer. The applicability of this new machine learning technique is demonstrated in an agriculture-dominated area where nitrate concentrations in groundwater can exceed the trigger value of 50. mg/L, at many locations. A comprehensive GIS database of twenty-four parameters related to intrinsic hydrogeologic proprieties, driving forces, remotely sensed variables and physical-chemical variables measured in "situ", were used as inputs to build different predictive models of nitrate pollution. RF measures of importance were also used to define the most significant predictors of nitrate pollution in groundwater, allowing the establishment of the pollution sources (pressures).The potential of RF for generating a vulnerability map to nitrate pollution is assessed considering multiple criteria related to variations in the algorithm parameters and the accuracy of the maps. The performance of the RF is also evaluated in comparison to the logistic regression (LR) method using different efficiency measures to ensure their generalization ability. Prediction results show the ability of RF to build accurate models with strong predictive capabilities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Decision-making processes in complex systems generally require the mechanisms to make the tradeoff among contradicting design criteria. When multiple objectives are involved in decision making or machine learning, a crucial step is to determine the weights of individual objectives to the system-level performance. Determining the weights of multiobjectives is an evaluation process, and it has been often treated as an optimization problem. However, our preliminary investigation has shown that existing methodologies in dealing with the weights of multiobjectives have some obvious limitations in the sense that the determination of weights is tackled as a single optimization problem, a result based on such an optimization is incomprehensive, and it can even be unreliable when the information about multiple objectives is incomplete such as an incompleteness caused by poor data. The constraints of weights are also discussed. Variable weights are natural in decision-making processes. Therefore, we are motivated to develop a systematic methodology in determining variable weights of multiobjectives. The roles of weights in an original multiobjective decision-making or machine-learning problem are analyzed, and the weights are determined with the aid of a modular neural network. The inconsistency issue of weights is particularly discussed. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Banks and financial institutions rely on loan default prediction models in credit risk management. An important yet challenging task in developing and applying default classification models is model evaluation and selection. This study proposes an evaluation approach for bank loan default classification models based on multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. A large real-life Chinese bank loan dataset is used to validate the proposed approach. Specifically, a set of performance metrics is utilized to measure a selection of statistical and machine-learning default models. The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), a MCDM method, takes the performances of default classification models on multiple performance metrics as inputs to generate a ranking of default risk models. In addition, feature selection and sampling techniques are applied to the data pre-processing step to handle high dimensionality and class unbalancedness of bank loan default data. The results show that K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm has a good potential in bank loan default prediction. © 2014 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

abstract={Dimensionality reduction of attribute set is a common preprocessing step used in machine learning. This step is especially important for high-dimensional data with low-dimensional representation such as gene expression data. Feature reduction is essential in the case of mi-croarray data because most of the microarray data attributes are believed to be unrelated to observed classes. This paper proposes a three-step feature selection framework based on feature clustering, multi-criteria assessment (Borda count) and Markov blanket. The proposed framework is a filter method so it can be used with any classification algorithm. Its classification performance and selection stability were assessed. The experimental studies were performed on 10 microarray data sets. The experimental evaluation showed that the Markov blanket filter produces results comparable to state-of-art methods in terms of classification performance. However it tends to produce unstable solutions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014},

abstract={Dry eye syndrome is a prevalent disease which affects a wide range of the population and can be diagnosed through an automatic technique for tear film lipid layer classification. In this setting, class binarization techniques and feature selection are powerful methods to reduce the size of the output and input spaces, respectively. These approaches are expected to reduce the complexity of the multi-class problem of tear film classification. In previous researches, several machine learning algorithms have been tried and only evaluated in terms of accuracy. Up to now, the evaluation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has not been done in depth. This paper presents a methodology to evaluate the classification performance of ANNs using several measures. For this purpose, the multiple-criteria decision-making method called TOPSIS has been used. The results obtained demonstrate that class binarization and feature selection improves the performance of ANNs on tear film classification. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract={The purpose of current investigation is to develop a robust intelligent framework to achieve efficient and reliable operating process parameters for laser solid freeform fabrication (LSFF) process as a recent and ongoing topic of investigation. Firstly, based on mutable smart bee algorithm (MSBA) and fuzzy inference system (FIS) two models are developed to identify the clad hight (deposited layer thickness) and the melt pool depth as functions of scanning speed, laser power and mass powder. Using the obtained model, the well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithm called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used for multi-criterion optimization of LSFF process. According to the available reported information and also the author's experiments, it is observed that the obtained Pareto front is not justifiable since it fails to cover the entire Pareto hyper-volume due to the lack of intensified exploration. To tackle this deficiency, authors execute a post optimization process through utilizing a competitive unsupervised machine learning approach known as self-organizing map (SOM) with cubic spatial topology. Achieved results indicate that this grid based network is capable of enhancing the intensification of Pareto solutions since its synaptic weights successfully imitate the characteristics of non-dominated solutions (optimal values of mass powder, laser power and scanning speed). For extracting the corresponding objective functions of these non-dominated synaptic weights, MSBA-FIS is used again to map the operating parameters to objective functions space. After the termination of abovementioned procedures, a valuable archive, containing a set of non-dominated solutions, is obtained which lets the authors to make a deliberate engineering trade-off. Simulation experiments reveal that the proposed intelligent framework is highly capable to cope with complex engineering systems. Besides, it is observed that MSBA is more efficient in evolving the structure of hierarchical fuzzy inference system in comparison with classic hierarchical GA-FIS model. This rises from the simple structure of MSBA that turns it into a fast and robust algorithm for handling constraint distributed systems (i.e. hierarchical FIS in current investigation). The obtained results also indicate that the introduced intelligent framework is applicable for optimal design of complex engineering systems where there exists no analytical formulation that describes the phenomenon as well as information of optimal operating parameters. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Data mining algorithms based on their functions can be divided in four categories; Classification, Feature selection, Assassination rules and Clustering. One of the most important of these functions is feature selection which has been increasingly developed and many researchers provide variety of algorithms to deal with this function in recent years. Feature selection algorithms mostly used for obtaining more precise and strong machine learning algorithms along with reducing the computation time. Another growing science is Multiple Criteria Decision Making techniques witch it also has variety of methods. In this paper, we use both Data Envelopment Analysis which is a useful technique for determining the efficiency of decision-making units and Entropy method which its function is weighting the criteria to selecting the appropriate features. Hence, our novel integrated method has been analyzed by implementing in a testing environment and we apply it on three datasets of UCI's datasets, so the result showed our innovated approach has comparable accuracy with the other feature selections algorithms. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Today, it is common to include machine learning components in software products. These components offer specific functionalities such as image recognition, time series analysis, and forecasting but may not satisfy the non-functional constraints of the software products. It is difficult to identify suitable learning algorithms for a particular task and software product because the non-functional requirements of the product affect algorithm suitability. A particular suitability evaluation may thus require the assessment of multiple criteria to analyse trade-offs between functional and non-functional requirements. For this purpose, we present a method for APPlication-Oriented Validation and Evaluation (APPrOVE). This method comprises four sequential steps that address the stated evaluation problem. The method provides a common ground for different stakeholders and enables a multi-expert and multi-criteria evaluation of machine learning algorithms prior to inclusion in software products. Essentially, the problem addressed in this article concerns how to choose the appropriate machine learning component for a particular software product. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

abstract={Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most widely used prediction technique in recommender systems. It makes recommendations based on ratings that users have assigned to items. Most of the current CF recommender systems maintain only single user ratings inside the user-item ratings matrix. Multi-criteria based CF presents a possibility of providing accurate recommendations by considering the user preferences in multi aspects of items. However, in the multi-criteria CF, the user behavior about items' features is frequently subjective, imprecise and vague. These in turn induce uncertainty in reasoning and representation of items' features that exactly cannot be solved using crisp machine learning techniques. In contrast, approaches such as fuzzy methods instead of crisp methods can better solve the issue of uncertainty. In addition, fuzzy methods can predict the users' preference more accurately and even better alleviate the sparsity problem in overall rating by considering user perception about items' features. Apart from this, in the multi-criteria CF, users provide the ratings on different aspects (criteria) of an item in new dimensions; thereby, increasing the scalability problem. Appropriate dimensionality reduction techniques are thus needed to capture the high dimensions all together without reducing them into lower dimensions to reveal the latent associations among the components. This study presents a new model for multi-criteria CF using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) combined with subtractive clustering and Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD). HOSVD is used for dimensionality reduction for improving the scalability problem and ANFIS is used for extracting fuzzy rules from the experimental dataset, alleviating the sparsity problems in overall ratings and representing and reasoning the users' behavior on items' features. Experimental results on real-world dataset show that combination of two techniques remarkably improves the predictive accuracy and recommendation quality of multi-criteria CF. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Classification of wine represents a multi-criteria decision-making problem characterized by great complexity, non-linearity and lack of objective information regarding the quality of the desired final product. Volatile compounds of wines elaborated from four Galician (NW Spain) autochthonous white Vitis vinifera from four consecutive vintages were analysed by gas chromatography (FID, FPD and MS detectors), and several aroma compounds were used for correctly classifying autochthonous white grape varieties (Albariño, Treixadura, Loureira and Dona Branca). The objective of the work is twofold: to find a classification model able to precisely differentiate between existing grape varieties (i.e. assuring the authenticity), and to assess the discriminatory power of different family compounds over well-known classifiers (i.e. guaranteeing the typicality). From the experiments carried out, and given the fact that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was not able to accurately separate all the wine varieties, this work investigates the suitability of applying different machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e.: Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, MultiLayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbour and Naïve Bayes) for classification purposes. Perfect classification accuracy is obtained by the Random Forest algorithm, whilst the other alternatives achieved promising results using only part of the available information. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Significant progress has been made on preference representation and the automated learning of preference models in all these areas. Preference learning deals with the induction of preference models from empirical data, such as explicit preference information or implicit feedback about preferences. A classical problem setting in this regard is the approximation of the utility function of a single agent on the basis of some question-answer process. Experts also aim to demonstrate many facets of this developing field of machine learning to provide an update on mature high-quality work in this area and to connect to related research areas.},

abstract={Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) offers a diversity of approaches designed for providing the decision maker (DM) with a recommendation concerning a set of alternatives (items, actions) evaluated from multiple points of view, called criteria. This paper aims at drawing attention of the Machine Learning (ML) community upon recent advances in a representative MCDA methodology, called Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR). ROR learns by examples in order to rank a set of alternatives, thus considering a similar problem as Preference Learning (ML-PL) does. However, ROR implements the interactive preference construction paradigm, which should be perceived as a mutual learning of the model and the DM. The paper clarifies the specific interpretation of the concept of preference learning adopted in ROR and MCDA, comparing it to the usual concept of preference learning considered within ML. This comparison concerns a structure of the considered problem, types of admitted preference information, a character of the employed preference models, ways of exploiting them, and techniques to arrive at a final ranking. © 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract={In recent years, the unrestrainable growth of the volume of data has raised new challenges in machine learning regarding scalability. Scalability comprises not simply accuracy but several other measures regarding computational resources. In order to compare the scalability of algorithms it is necessary to establish a method allowing integrating all these measures into a single rank. These methods should be able to i) merge results of algorithms to be compared from different benchmark data sets, ii) quantitatively measure the difference between algorithms, and iii) weight some measures against others if necessary. In order to manage these issues, in this research we propose the use of TOPSIS as multiple-criteria decision-making method to rank algorithms. The use of this method will be illustrated to obtain a study on the scalability of five of the most well-known training algorithms for artificial neural networks (ANNs). © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Aim: To analyse spatial trade-offs in conservation of mammals, considering benefits of biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic costs. Location: Cerrado Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil. Methods: We built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 154 mammals inhabiting the cerrado. We combined model projections to produce consensus maps of species' distributions for three types of models (envelope, statistical and machine-learning models). We used these range summaries as input data in spatial prioritization analyses. We compared six conservation scenarios, considering human population density, land cost, anthropogenic land use, political willingness to act and the distribution of species using trade-off analyses. We complemented the current network of protected areas, aiming to achieve a target of 17% of land protection in the cerrado. Results: Species-rich sites coincide with regions with high human population, high land cost, high anthropogenic land use and diverse levels of political willingness to act. We found a significant change in spatial priorities when we included socioeconomic and political dimensions in analyses: top-priority sites moved north, reduced by 68% potential conservation conflicts with human population, reduced by 72% the total monetary cost of actions and reduced by 68% conflict with other anthropogenic land uses. It also increased by 80% the beneficial effect of political willingness to act. Main conclusions: Our results reinforce the idea that using only biological criteria for proposing spatial conservation priorities can undermine conservation plans given increases in socioeconomic and political conflicts. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Being able to assess software quality is essential as software is ubiquitous in every aspect of our day- to-day lives. In this paper, we build upon existing research and metrics for defining software quality and propose a way to automatically assess software quality based on these metrics. In particular, we show that the problem of assessing the quality of software can be viewed as a multi-criteria decision- making (MCDM) problem. In Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), decisions are based on several criteria that are usually conicting and non-homogenously satisfied. We use non-additive (fuzzy) measures combined with the Choquet integral to solve MCDM problems for they allow to model and aggregate the levels of satisfaction of the several criteria of the problem at hand by considering their relationships. However, in practice, it is difficult to identify such fuzzy measures. An automated process is then necessary and can be used when sample data is available. We propose to automatically assess software by modeling experts' decision process and extracting the fuzzy measure corresponding to their reasoning process: to do this, we use samples of the target experts' decision as seed data to automatically extract the fuzzy measure corresponding to the experts' decision process. In particular, we propose an algorithm to efficiently extract fuzzy measures that is a combination of the Bees algorithm and an interval constraint solver. Our experimental results show that we are able to improve some of the results obtained through previous approaches to automatic software quality assessment that used traditional machine learning techniques. © 2013 World Academic Press, UK.

abstract={Modern machine learning problems typically have multiple criteria, but there is currently no systematic mathematical theory to guide the design of formulations and exploration of alternatives. Homotopy methods are a promising approach to characterize solution spaces by smoothly tracking solutions from one formulation (typically an "easy" problem) to another (typically a "hard" problem). New results in constructing homotopy maps for constrained clustering problems are here presented, which combine quadratic loss functions with discrete evaluations of constraint violations are presented. These maps balance requirements of locality in clusters as well as those of discrete must-link and must-not-link constraints. Experimental results demonstrate advantages in tracking solutions compared to state-of-the-art constrained clustering algorithms.},

abstract={The occurrence of ectotherm disease vectors outside of their previous distribution area and the emergence of vector-borne diseases can be increasingly observed at a global scale and are accompanied by a growing number of studies which investigate the vast range of determining factors and their causal links. Consequently, a broad span of scientific disciplines is involved in tackling these complex phenomena. First, we evaluate the citation behaviour of relevant scientific literature in order to clarify the question "do scientists consider results of other disciplines to extend their expertise?" We then highlight emerging tools and concepts useful for risk assessment. Correlative models (regression-based, machine-learning and profile techniques), mechanistic models (basic reproduction number R 0) and methods of spatial regression, interaction and interpolation are described. We discuss further steps towards multidisciplinary approaches regarding new tools and emerging concepts to combine existing approaches such as Bayesian geostatistical modelling, mechanistic models which avoid the need for parameter fitting, joined correlative and mechanistic models, multi-criteria decision analysis and geographic profiling. We take the quality of both occurrence data for vector, host and disease cases, and data of the predictor variables into consideration as both determine the accuracy of risk area identification. Finally, we underline the importance of multidisciplinary research approaches. Even if the establishment of communication networks between scientific disciplines and the share of specific methods is time consuming, it promises new insights for the surveillance and control of vector-borne diseases worldwide. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Project selection is a complex decision making process that is influenced by multiple and often conflicting objectives. The complexity of the project selection problem is due to the high number of projects from which a subset (portfolio) has to be chosen. We present a hybrid fuzzy rule-based multi-objective framework for sustainable project portfolio selection. The multiple and conflicting objectives are considered as the input variables in a Fuzzy Rule-Based (FRB) system developed to estimate the overall fitness (suitability) of the potential project portfolios. A hybrid multi-objective framework integrates and synthesizes the results from a data mining model with the results from a Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) model and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to design the structure of the proposed FRB system. The proposed framework simultaneously considers the accuracy maximization and the complexity minimization objectives. A Genetic Based Machine Learning (GBML) method is utilized to design an alternative FRB system for comparison purposes. The proposed framework and the GBML method are used to assess the alternative project portfolios in a real-world financial services institution. The statistical analysis shows the performance dominance of the proposed hybrid framework over the GBML method based on selected accuracy and interoperability measures. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In such cases, the bipolar Choquet integral with respect to bi-capacities was introduced. In this paper, we address the problem of eliciting a bipolar Choquet integral with respect to a 2-additive bi-capacity. We assume that we are given a set of examples with (i) their scores distribution in regard to several criteria and (ii) their overall scores. We propose two types of optimization problems that allow identifying the parameters of a 2-additive bi-capacity such that the inferred bipolar Choquet integral is consistent with the given examples as much as possible. Furthermore, since the elicitation process we study has many relationships with problems in statistical machine learning, we also present the links between our models and concepts developed in the latter field. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A number of practical optimization problems are posed as many-objective (more than three objectives) problems. Most of the existing evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms, which target the entire Pareto-front are not equipped to handle many-objective problems. Though there have been copious efforts to overcome the challenges posed by such problems, there does not exist a generic procedure to effectively handle them. This paper presents a simplify and solve framework for handling many-objective optimization problems. In that, a given problem is simplified by identification and elimination of the redundant objectives, before interactively engaging the decision maker to converge to the most preferred solution on the Pareto-optimal front. The merit of performing objective reduction before interacting with the decision maker is two fold. Firstly, the revelation that certain objectives are redundant, significantly reduces the complexity of the optimization problem, implying lower computational cost and higher search efficiency. Secondly, it is well known that human beings are not efficient in handling several factors (objectives in the current context) at a time. Hence, simplifying the problem a priori addresses the fundamental issue of cognitive overload for the decision maker, which may help avoid inconsistent preferences during the different stages of interactive engagement. The implementation of the proposed framework is first demonstrated on a three-objective problem, followed by its application on two real-world engineering problems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={We propose a novel method for preference learning or, more specifically, learning to rank, where the task is to learn a ranking model that takes a subset of alternatives as input and produces a ranking of these alternatives as output. Just like in the case of conventional classifier learning, training information is provided in the form of a set of labeled instances, with labels or, say, preference degrees taken from an ordered categorical scale. This setting is known as multipartite ranking in the literature. Our approach is based on the idea of using the (discrete) Choquet integral as an underlying model for representing ranking functions. Being an established aggregation function in fields such as multiple criteria decision making and information fusion, the Choquet integral offers a number of interesting properties that make it attractive from a machine learning perspective, too. The learning problem itself comes down to properly specifying the fuzzy measure on which the Choquet integral is defined. This problem is formalized as a margin maximization problem and solved by means of a cutting plane algorithm. The performance of our method is tested on a number of benchmark datasets. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, our goal is to track visual targets using residual vector quantization (RVQ). We compare our results with principal components analysis (PCA) and tree structured vector quantization (TSVQ) based tracking. This work is significant since PCA is commonly used in the Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning and Computer Vision communities. On the other hand, TSVQ is commonly used in the Signal Processing and data compression communities. RVQ with more than two stages has not received much attention due to the difficulty in producing stable designs. In this work, we bring together these different approaches into an integrated tracking framework and show that RVQ tracking performs best according to multiple criteria over a variety of publicly available datasets. Moreover, an advantage of our approach is a learning-based tracker that builds the target model while it tracks, thus avoiding the costly step of building target models prior to tracking. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically assessing sofware quality. We show that we can look at this problem, called Software Quality Assessment (SQA), as a multicriteria decision-making problem. Indeed, just like software is assessed along different criteria, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is about decisions that are based on several criteria that are usually conflicting and non-homogenously satisfied. Nonadditive (fuzzy) measures along with the Choquet integral can be used to model and aggregate the levels of satisfaction of these criteria by considering their relationships. However, in practice, fuzzy measures are difficult to identify. An automated process is necessary and possible when sample data is available. Several optimization approaches have been proposed to extract fuzzy measures from sample data; e.g., genetic algorithms, gradient descent algorithms, and the Bees algorithm, all local search techniques. In this article, we propose a hybrid approach, combining the Bees algorithm and an interval constraint solver, resulting in a focused search expected to be less prone to falling into local results. Our approach, when tested on SQA decision data, shows promise and compares well to previous approaches to SQA that were using machine learning techniques. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Determining the number of clusters in a data set is an essential yet difficult step in cluster analysis. Since this task involves more than one criterion, it can be modeled as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This paper proposes a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM)-based approach to estimate the number of clusters for a given data set. In this approach, MCDM methods consider different numbers of clusters as alternatives and the outputs of any clustering algorithm on validity measures as criteria. The proposed method is examined by an experimental study using three MCDM methods, the well-known clustering algorithm-k-means, ten relative measures, and fifteen public-domain UCI machine learning data sets. The results show that MCDM methods work fairly well in estimating the number of clusters in the data and outperform the ten relative measures considered in the study. © 2012 Peng et al.},

abstract={Recommender systems (RS) have shown to be valuable tools on e-commerce sites which help the customers identify the most relevant items within large product catalogs. In systems that rely on collaborative filtering, the generation of the product recommendations is based on ratings provided by the user community. While in many domains users are only allowed to attach an overall rating to the items, increasingly more online platforms allow their customers to evaluate the available items along different dimensions. Previous work has shown that these criteria ratings contain valuable information that can be exploited in the recommendation process. In this work we present new methods to leverage information derived from multi-dimensional ratings to improve the predictive accuracy of such multi-criteria recommender systems. In particular, we propose to use Support Vector regression to determine the relative importance of the individual criteria ratings and suggest to combine user- and item-based regression models in a weighted approach. Beside the automatic adjustment and optimization of the combination weights, we also explore different feature selection strategies to further improve the quality of the recommendations. An experimental analysis on two real-world rating datasets reveals that our method outperforms both recent single-rating algorithms based on matrix factorization as well as previous methods based on multi-criteria ratings in terms of the predictive accuracy. We therefore see the usage of multi-criteria customer ratings as a promising opportunity for e-commerce sites to improve the quality and precision of their online recommendation services. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={The learning of predictive models that guarantee monotonicity in the input variables has received increasing attention in machine learning in recent years. By trend, the difficulty of ensuring monotonicity increases with the flexibility or, say, nonlinearity of a model. In this paper, we advocate the so-called Choquet integral as a tool for learning monotone nonlinear models. While being widely used as a flexible aggregation operator in different fields, such as multiple criteria decision making, the Choquet integral is much less known in machine learning so far. Apart from combining monotonicity and flexibility in a mathematically sound and elegant manner, the Choquet integral has additional features making it attractive from a machine learning point of view. Notably, it offers measures for quantifying the importance of individual predictor variables and the interaction between groups of variables. Analyzing the Choquet integral from a classification perspective, we provide upper and lower bounds on its VC-dimension. Moreover, as a methodological contribution, we propose a generalization of logistic regression. The basic idea of our approach, referred to as choquistic regression, is to replace the linear function of predictor variables, which is commonly used in logistic regression to model the log odds of the positive class, by the Choquet integral. First experimental results are quite promising and suggest that the combination of monotonicity and flexibility offered by the Choquet integral facilitates strong performance in practical applications. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={The topic of preferences is a new branch of machine learning and data mining, and it has attracted considerable attention in artificial intelligence research in recent years. Representing and processing knowledge in terms of preferences is appealing as it allows one to specify desires in a declarative way, to combine qualitative and quantitative modes of reasoning, and to deal with inconsistencies and exceptions in a flexible manner. Preference learning is concerned with the acquisition of preference models from data it involves learning from observations that reveal information about the preferences of an individual or a class of individuals, and building models that generalize beyond such training data. This is the first book dedicated to this topic, and the treatment is comprehensive. The editors first offer a thorough introduction, including a systematic categorization according to learning task and learning technique, along with a unified notation. The remainder of the book is organized into parts that follow the developed framework, complementing survey articles with in-depth treatises of current research topics in this area. The book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and data mining, and in fields such as multicriteria decision-making and operations research. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

abstract={A design support system with a new strategy for finding the optimal functional configurations of rooms for architectural layouts is presented. A set of configurations satisfying given constraints is generated and ranked according to multiple objectives. The method can be applied to problems in architectural practice, urban or graphic designwherever allocation of related geometrical elements of known shape is optimized. Although the methodology is shown using simplified examplesa single story residential building with two apartments each having two roomsthe results resemble realistic functional layouts. One example of a practical size problem of a layout of three apartments with a total of 20 rooms is demonstrated, where the generated solution can be used as a base for a realistic architectural blueprint. The discretization of design space is discussed, followed by application of a backtrack search algorithm used for generating a set of potentially 'good' room configurations. Next the solutions are classified by a machine learning method (FFN) as 'proper' or 'improper' according to the internal communication criteria. Examples of interactive ranking of the 'proper' configurations according to multiple criteria and choosing 'the best' ones are presented. The proposed framework is general and universalthe criteria, parameters and weights can be individually defined by a user and the search algorithm can be adjusted to a specific problem. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The purpose of spatial modelling in animal and public health is three-fold: describing existing spatial patterns of risk, attempting to understand the biological mechanisms that lead to disease occurrence and predicting what will happen in the medium to long-term future (temporal prediction) or in different geographical areas (spatial prediction). Traditional methods for temporal and spatial predictions include general and generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM) and Bayesian estimation methods. However, such models require both disease presence and absence data which are not always easy to obtain. Novel spatial modelling methods such as maximum entropy (MAXENT) and the genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP) require only disease presence data and have been used extensively in the fields of ecology and conservation, to model species distribution and habitat suitability. Other methods, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), use knowledge of the causal factors of disease occurrence to identify areas potentially suitable for disease. In addition to their less restrictive data requirements, some of these novel methods have been shown to outperform traditional statistical methods in predictive ability (Elith et al., 2006). This review paper provides details of some of these novel methods for mapping disease distribution, highlights their advantages and limitations, and identifies studies which have used the methods to model various aspects of disease distribution. © 2011.},

abstract={Accurate estimation of site productivity is crucial for sustainable forest resource management. In recent years, a variety of modelling approaches have been developed and applied to predict site index from a wide range of environmental variables, with varying success. The selection, application and comparison of suitable modelling techniques remains therefore a meticulous task, subject to ongoing research and debate.In this study, the performance of five modelling techniques was compared for the prediction of forest site index in two contrasting ecoregions: the temperate lowland of Flanders, Belgium, and the Mediterranean mountains in SW Turkey. The modelling techniques include statistical (multiple linear regression - MLR, classification and regression trees - CART, generalized additive models - GAM), as well as machine-learning (artificial neural networks - ANN) and hybrid techniques (boosted regression trees - BRT). Although the selected predictor variables differed largely, with mainly topographic predictor variables in the mountain area versus soil and humus variables in the lowland area, the techniques performed comparatively similar in both ecoregions.Stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) was found a well-suited multicriteria evaluation method to evaluate the performance of the modelling techniques. It has been applied on the individual species models of Flanders, as well as a species-independent evaluation, combining all developed models from the two contrasting ecoregions. We came to the conclusion that non-parametric models are better suited for predicting site index than traditional MLR. GAM and BRT are the preferred alternatives for a wide range of weight preferences. CART is preferred when very high weight is given to user-friendliness, whereas ANN is recommended when most weight is given to pure predictive performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Classification is a main data mining task, which aims at predicting the class label of new input data on the basis of a set of pre-classified samples. Multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) is used as a classification method in the data mining area, which can separate two or more classes by finding a discriminate hyperplane. Although MCLP shows good performance in dealing with linear separable data, it is no longer applicable when facing with nonlinear separable problems. A kernel-based multiple criteria linear programming (KMCLP) model is developed to solve nonlinear separable problems. In this method, a kernel function is introduced to project the data into a higher-dimensional space in which the data will have more chance to be linear separable. KMCLP performs well in some real applications. However, just as other prevalent data mining classifiers, MCLP and KMCLP learn only from training examples. In the traditional machine learning area, there are also classification tasks in which data sets are classified only by prior knowledge, i.e. expert systems. Some works combine the above two classification principles to overcome the faults of each approach. In this paper, we provide our recent works which combine the prior knowledge and the MCLP or KMCLP model to solve the problem when the input consists of not only training examples, but also prior knowledge. Specifically, how to deal with linear and nonlinear knowledge in MCLP and KMCLP models is the main concern of this paper. Numerical tests on the above models indicate that these models are effective in classifying data with prior knowledge. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The proposed learning methods consist of two stages: The first stage involves using the discretization techniques to obtain the required parameters for the PROAFTN method, and the second stage is the development of a new inductive approach to construct PROAFTN prototypes for classification. The comparative study is based on the generated classification accuracy of the algorithms on the data sets. For further robust analysis of the experiments, we used the Friedman statistical measure with the corresponding post hoc tests. The proposed approaches significantly improved the performance of the classification method PROAFTN. Based on the generated results on the same data sets, PROAFTN outperforms widely used classification algorithms. Furthermore, the method is simple, no preprocessing is required, and no loss of information during learning. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Today, emerging and increasing resistance to antibiotics has become a threat to public health worldwide. Antimicrobial peptides have unique action mechanisms making them an attractive therapeutic prospect to be applied against resistant bacteria. However, the major drawback is related with their high hemolytic activity which cancels out the safety requirements for a human antibiotic. Therefore, additional efforts are needed to develop new antimicrobial peptides that possess a greater potency for bacterial cells and less or no toxicity over erythrocytes. In this paper, we introduce a practical approach to simultaneously deal with these two conflicting properties. The convergence of machine learning techniques and desirability theory allowed us to derive a simple, predictive, and interpretable multicriteria classification rule for simultaneously handling the antibacterial and hemolytic properties of a set of cyclic β-hairpin cationic peptidomimetics (Cβ-HCPs). The multicriteria classification rule exhibited a prediction accuracy of about 80% on training and external validation sets. Results from an additional concordance test have shown an excellent agreement between the multicriteria classification rule predictions and the predictions from independent classifiers for complementary antibacterial and hemolytic activities, respectively, evidencing the reliability of the multicriteria classification rule. The rule was also consistent with the general mode of action of cationic peptides pointing out its biophysical relevance. We also propose a multicriteria virtual screening strategy based on the joint use of the multicriteria classification rule, desirability, similarity, and chemometrics concepts. The ability of such a virtual screening strategy to prioritize selective (nonhemolytic) antibacterial Cβ-HCPs was assessed and challenged for their predictivity regarding the training, validation, and overall data. In doing so, we were able to rank a selective antibacterial Cβ-HCP earlier than a biologically inactive or nonselective antibacterial Cβ-HCP with a probability of ca. 0.9. Our results thus indicate that promising chemoinformatics tools were obtained by considering both the multicriteria classification rule and the virtual screening strategy, which could, for instance, be used to aid the discovery and development of potent and nontoxic antimicrobial peptides. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Decision support is required when complex situations arise during product development which takes into account the whole product life cycle. This is especially true when impacted by the ill-defined consequences on the environment in an ever increasingly eco-conscious world. Analytical Hierarchy process (AHP) is one method of providing decision support, and is an instance of a decision support heuristic. Machine learning methods have proved themselves on many well defined problems with clearly defined objectives. In particular, we focus on the recently emerging field of hyper-heuristics which is a blend of human designed heuristics, with the extension of machine designed heuristics. In essence humans can operate at the higher concept or abstract level, while machine heuristics can operate at a lower level. There are a number of issues within the proposed framework, including visualizing a multi-dimensional surface of designs along the Pareto front, as well as dealing with different types of data during the decision making process. It is proposed that Hyper-heuristics, supplemented with other methodologies to deal with vague or missing data, offer a framework in which to begin to address several of the complex compromises that arise during product development.},

To apply PROAFTN, values of several parameters need to be determined prior to classification. These parameters include boundaries of intervals and relative weights for each attribute. Based on these requirements, the hybrid approach, named DEPRO-RVNS, is presented in this study. In some cases, the major problem when applying DE to some classification problems was the premature convergence of some individuals to local optima. To eliminate this shortcoming and to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of DE, such individuals were set to iteratively re-explored using RVNS. Based on the generated results on both training and testing data, it is shown that the performance of PROAFTN is significantly improved. Furthermore, the experimental study shows that DEPRO-RVNS outperforms well-known machine learning classifiers in a variety of problems.},

This paper adopts the methodology of reactive search optimization (RSO) for evolutionary interactive multiobjective optimization. RSO follows to the paradigm of learning while optimizing, through the use of online machine learning techniques as an integral part of a self-tuning optimization scheme. User judgments of couples of solutions are used to build robust incremental models of the user utility function, with the objective to reduce the cognitive burden required from the DM to identify a satisficing solution. The technique of support vector ranking is used together with a $k$-fold cross-validation procedure to select the best kernel for the problem at hand, during the utility function training procedure. Experimental results are presented for a series of benchmark problems. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={An isolated outbreak of the emerging forest disease sudden oak death was discovered in Oregon forests in 2001. Despite considerable control efforts, disease continues to spread from the introduction site due to slow and incomplete detection and eradication. Annual field surveys and laboratory tests between 2001 and 2009 confirmed a total of 802 infested locations. Here, we apply two invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) of sudden oak death establishment and spread risk to target early detection and control further disease spread in Oregon forests. The goal was to develop (1) a model of potential distribution that estimates the level and spatial variability of disease establishment and spread risk for western Oregon, and (2) a model of actual distribution that quantifies the relative likelihood of current invasion in the quarantine area. Our predictions were based on four groups of primary parameters that vary in space and time: climate conditions, topographical factors, abundance and susceptibility of host vegetation, and dispersal pressure. First, we used multi-criteria evaluation to identify large-scale areas at potential risk of infection. We mapped and ranked host abundance and susceptibility using geospatial vegetation data developed with gradient nearest neighbor imputation. The host vegetation and climate variables were parameterized in accordance to their epidemiological importance and the final appraisal scores were summarized by month to represent a cumulative spread risk index, standardized as five categories from very low to very high risk. Second, using the field data for calibration we applied the machine-learning method, maximum entropy, to predict the actual distribution of the sudden oak death epidemic. The dispersal pressure incorporated in the statistical model estimates the force of invasion at all susceptible locations, allowing us to quantify the relative likelihood of current disease incidence rather than its potential distribution. Our predictions show that 65km2 of forested land was invaded by 2009, but further disease spread threatens more than 2100km2 of forests across the western region of Oregon (very high and high risk). Areas at greatest risk of disease spread are concentrated in the southwest region of Oregon where the highest densities of susceptible host species exist. This research identifies high priority locations for early detection and invasion control and illustrates how iSDMs can be used to analyze the actual versus potential distribution of emerging infectious disease in a complex, heterogeneous ecosystem. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A user's informational need and preferences can be modeled by criteria, which in turn can be used to prioritize candidate results and produce a ranked list. We examine the use of such a criteria-based user model separately in two representative recommendation tasks: news article recommendations and product recommendations. We ask the following: are there nonlinear interactions among the criteria; and should the models be personalized? We assume that that user ratings on each criterion are available, and use machine learning to infer a user model that combines these multiple ratings into a single overall rating. We found that the ratings of different criteria have a nonlinear interaction in some cases, for example, article novelty and subject relevance often interact. We also found that these interactions vary from user to user. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In this paper, a new hybrid metaheuristic learning algorithm is introduced to choose the best parameters for the classification method PROAFTN. PROAFTN is a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method which requires values of several parameters to be determined prior to classification. These parameters include boundaries of intervals and relative weights for each attribute. The proposed learning algorithm, identified as PSOPRO-RVNS as it integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS), is used to automatically determine all PROAFTN parameters. The combination of PSO with RVNS allows to improve the exploration capabilities of PSO by setting some search points to be iteratively re-explored using RVNS. Based on the generated results, experimental evaluations show that PSOPRO-RVNS outperforms six well-known machine learning classifiers in a variety of problems. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Forestry science has a long tradition of studying the relationship between stand productivity and abiotic and biotic site characteristics, such as climate, topography, soil and vegetation. Many of the early site quality modelling studies related site index to environmental variables using basic statistical methods such as linear regression. Because most ecological variables show a typical non-linear course and a non-constant variance distribution, a large fraction of the variation remained unexplained by these linear models. More recently, the development of more advanced non-parametric and machine learning methods provided opportunities to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, these methods also have drawbacks. Due to their increasing complexity they are not only more difficult to implement and interpret, but also more vulnerable to overfitting. Especially in a context of regionalisation, this may prove to be problematic. Although many non-parametric and machine learning methods are increasingly used in applications related to forest site quality assessment, their predictive performance has only been assessed for a limited number of methods and ecosystems. In this study, five different modelling techniques are compared and evaluated, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), generalized additive models (GAM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Each method is used to model site index of homogeneous stands of three important tree species of the Taurus Mountains (Turkey): Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra and Cedrus libani. Site index is related to soil, vegetation and topographical variables, which are available for 167 sample plots covering all important environmental gradients in the research area. The five techniques are compared in a multi-criteria decision analysis in which different model performance measures, ecological interpretability and user-friendliness are considered as criteria. When combining these criteria, in most cases GAM is found to outperform all other techniques for modelling site index for the three species. BRT is a good alternative in case the ecological interpretability of the technique is of higher importance. When user-friendliness is more important MLR and CART are the preferred alternatives. Despite its good predictive performance, ANN is penalized for its complex, non-transparent models and big training effort. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We present an integrated methodology composed of a role-playing game on land adjudication from which we extract narrative and spatially explicit drivers of land-use decisions. We show how geographic information systems (GIS), qualitative decision-matrix analyses, a simple rule-based model using multi-criteria evaluations (MCE), and a machine learning-based land-transformation model (LTM) can be used harmoniously to study complex socio-ecological systems. We evaluate how each technique performs in the study of complex socio-ecological systems using a multi-tier framework detailing how each method analyzes the resource system, resource units, governance system, users and interactions and outcomes in the system. We show that each approach enhances our understanding of the land-use decision making process. Each method provides various information on the drivers of land-use decision, some focusing more on spatial components of socio-ecological systems (resource system and resource unit) and other having a strong emphasis on social mechanisms (governance system, users, interactions and outcomes). Furthermore, we shed light into the existence of a flow of information between the various methods enhancing our understanding of land-use drivers. We end with a discussion on methodological tradeoffs between models and the value of our more holistic approach to modeling land-use drivers and decisions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The inference of the phylogenetic tree that best express the evolutionary relationships concerning data is one of the central problem of bioinformatics. Several single optimality criterion have been proposed for the phylogenetic reconstruction problem. However, different criteria may lead to conflicting phylogenies. In this scenario, a multi-objective approach can be useful since it could produce a set of optimal trees according to multiple criteria. PhyloMOEA is a multi objective evolutionary approach applied to phylogenetic inference using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood criteria. On the other hand, the computational power required for phylogenetic inference of large alignments easily surpasses the capabilities of single machines. In this context, the parallelization of the heuristic reconstruction methods can not only help to reduce the inference execution time but also improve the results quality and search robustness. On the other hand, The PhyloMOEA parallelization represents the next development step in order to reduce the execution time. In this paper, we present the PhyloMOEA parallel version developed using the ParadisEO framework. The experiments conducted show significant speedup in the execution time for the employed datasets. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Transductive inference has gained popularity in recent years as a means to develop pattern classification approaches that address the specific issue of predicting the class label of a given data point, instead of the more general problem of inferring the ideal classifier function. In this paper, we propose a Generalized Query by Transduction (GQBT) approach for active learning in the online setting. This approach is based on the theory of conformal predictions, which has recently been proposed based on principles of algorithmic randomness, transductive inference and hypothesis testing. The proposed GQBT approach can be used along with any existing pattern classification algorithm, and can also be used to combine multiple criteria in selecting an unlabeled example appropriately in the active learning process. The results of our experiments with different datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository demonstrate high promise in the proposed approach, with significantly lower label complexities than other existing online active learning approaches. The GQBT approach was also evaluated on face recognition using videos from the VidTIMIT dataset, and the observed superior performance supports the potential of applicability of the proposed approach in real-world problems. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Case study addresses NW slopes of Fruška Gora Mountain, Serbia. Landslide activity is quite notorious in this region, especially along the Danube's right river bank, and recently intensified seismicity coupled with atmospheric precipitation might be critical for triggering new landslide occurrences. Hence, it is not a moment too soon for serious landslide susceptibility assessment in this region. State-of-the-art approaches had been taken into consideration, cutting down to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithms, trained upon expert based model of landslide susceptibility (a multi-criteria analysis). The latter involved Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for weighting influences of different input parameters. These included elevation, slope angle, aspect, distance from flows, vegetation cover, lithology, and rainfall, to represent the natural factors of the slope stability. Processed in a GIS environment (as discrete or float raster layers) trough AHP, those parameters yielded susceptibility pattern, classified by the entropy model into four classes. Subsequently the susceptibility pattern has been featured as training set in SVM and k-NN algorithms. Detailed fitting involved several cases, among which SVM with Gaussian kernel over geo-dataset (coordinates and input parameters) reached the highest accuracy (88%) outperforming other considered cases by far. © 2009 IEEE.},

In this issue, the churn analysis is essential for the website to predict and describe who will leave or give up the use of the email. In this paper, Email users churn analysis is predicted and described by PMCLP (penalized multi-criteria linear programming) and decision tree method. In data mining and machine learning, PMCLP is a classification method with penalized multi-criteria linear programming and Decision tree is often used to deal with classification problem with a descriptive outcome. The first method shows its performance in the prediction result and the second method shows its performance in the predict result description. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Genetic fuzzy systems (GFS) are based on the use of genetic algorithms for designing fuzzy systems, and for providing them with learning and adaptation capabilities. In this context, fuzzy sets represent linguistic granules of information, contained in the antecedents and consequents of the rules, whereas the data used in the genetic learning is assumed to be crisp. GFS seldom deal with fuzzy-valued data. In this paper we address this problem, and propose a set of techniques that can be incorporated to different GFS in order to learn a knowledge base (KB) from interval and fuzzy data for regression problems. Details will be given about the representation of non-standard data with fuzzy sets, about the needed changes in the reasoning method of the fuzzy rule-based system, and also about a new generalization of the mean squared error to vague data. In addition, we will show that the learning process requires a genetic algorithm that must be capable of optimizing a multicriteria fitness function, containing both crisp and interval-valued criteria. Lastly, we benchmark our procedures with some machine learning related datasets and a real-world problem of marketing, and the techniques proposed here are shown to improve the generalization properties of other KBs obtained from crisp training data. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the statistical machine learning methods successful in the single-rating recommender system have not been investigated in the context of multi-criteria ratings. In this paper, we propose two types of multi-criteria probabilistic latent semantic analysis algorithms extended from the single-rating version. First, the mixture of multi-variate Gaussian distribution is assumed to be the underlying distribution of multi-criteria ratings of each user. Second, we further assume the mixture of the linear Gaussian regression model as the underlying distribution of multi-criteria ratings of each user, inspired by the Bayesian network and linear regression. The experiment results on the Yahoo!Movies ratings data set show that the full multi-variate Gaussian model and the linear Gaussian regression model achieve a stable performance gain over other tested methods. © 2009 - IOS Press.},

abstract={For the outranking relation theory, the ELECTRE methods are one of the most extensively used outranking methods. To measure the degree of agreement and the degree of disagreement of the proposition "one alternative outranks another alternative", the concordance and discordance relations are usually associated with the outranking relation. Instead of the traditional single-layer perceptron (SLP) developed according to the multiple-attribute utility theory, this paper contributes to develop a novel ELECTRE-based SLP for multicriteria classification problems based on the ELECTRE methods involving pairwise comparisons among patterns. A genetic-algorithm-based method is then designed to determine connection weights. A real-world data set involving bankruptcy analysis obtained from Moody's Industrial Manuals is employed to examine the classification performance of the proposed ELECTRE-based model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model performs well compared to an arsenal of well-known classification methods involving quantitative disciplines of statistics and machine learning. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The mathematical representation of human preferences has been a subject of study for researchers in different fields. In multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and fuzzy modeling, preference models are typically constructed by interacting with the human decision maker (DM). However, it is known that a DM often has difficulties to specify precise values for certain parameters of the model. He/she instead feels more comfortable to give holistic judgements for some of the alternatives. Inference and elicitation procedures then assist the DM to find a satisfactory model and to assess unjudged alternatives. In a related but more statistical way, machine learning algorithms can also infer preference models with similar setups and purposes, but here less interaction with the DM is required/allowed. In this article we discuss the main differences between both types of inference and, in particular, we present a hybrid approach that combines the best of both worlds. This approach consists of a very general kernel-based framework for constructing and inferring preference models. Additive models, for which interpretability is preserved, and utility models can be considered as special cases. Besides generality, important benefits of this approach are its robustness to noise and good scalability. We show in detail how this framework can be utilized to aggregate single-criterion outranking relations, resulting in a flexible class of preference models for which domain knowledge can be specified by a DM. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Declarative Modelling is an early-phase design technique allowing the user to describe an object or an environment in abstract terms, closer to human intuition. The geometric solutions automatically yielded for such a description are evaluated by the user and may be subsequently used for the construction of a computational model of his/her preferences. Due to the physical limitations of the human evaluator, and the large number of the representations produced, only a subset of the latter are actually evaluated by the user and eventually a small number of them are approved, leading to imbalanced datasets in regard to the learning mechanism invoked. In the current work we discuss and assess the capability of a mechanism adopted for user modelling in a declarative design environment to handle this imbalance. The experimental results in this context indicate considerable efficiency in the prediction for the under-represented class. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Shot boundaries provide the basis for almost all high-level video content analysis approaches, validating it as one of the major prerequisites for efficient video indexing and retrieval in large video databases. The successful detection of both gradual and abrupt transitions is necessary to this end. In this paper a new gradual transition detection algorithm is proposed, based on novel features exhibiting less sensitivity to local or global motion than previously proposed ones. These features, each of which could serve as a stand-alone transition detection approach, are then combined using a machine learning technique, to result in a meta-segmentation scheme. Besides significantly improved performance, advantage of the proposed scheme is that there is no need for threshold selection, as opposed to what would be the case if any of the proposed features were used by themselves and as is typically the case in the relevant literature. Comparison of the proposed approach with four popular algorithms of the literature reveals the significantly improved performance of it. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Fuzzy rule-based classification systems (FRBCSs) are able to design interpretable classifiers but suffer from the curse of dimensionality when dealing with complex problems with a large number of features. In this contribution we explore the use of popular approaches for designing ensembles of classifiers in the machine learning field, bagging and random subspace, to design FRBCS multiclassifiers from a basic, heuristic fuzzy classification rule generation method, aiming to both improve their accuracy and to make them able to deal with high dimensional classification problems. Besides, a multicriteria genetic algorithm is proposed to select the component classifiers in the ensemble guided by the cumulative likelihood in order to look for an appropriate accuracy-complexity trade-off. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine learning offers a systematic framework for developing metrics that use multiple criteria to assess the quality of machine translation (MT). However, learning introduces additional complexities that may impact on the resulting metric's effectiveness. First, a learned metric is more reliable for translations that are similar to its training examples; this calls into question whether it is as effective in evaluating translations from systems that are not its contemporaries. Second, metrics trained from different sets of training examples may exhibit variations in their evaluations. Third, expensive developmental resources (such as translations that have been evaluated by humans) may be needed as training examples. This paper investigates these concerns in the context of using regression to develop metrics for evaluating machine-translated sentences. We track a learned metric's reliability across a 5 year period to measure the extent to which the learned metric can evaluate sentences produced by other systems. We compare metrics trained under different conditions to measure their variations. Finally, we present an alternative formulation of metric training in which the features are based on comparisons against pseudo-references in order to reduce the demand on human produced resources. Our results confirm that regression is a useful approach for developing new metrics for MT evaluation at the sentence level. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Our technique generalizes previous approaches in that it can learn optimal policies for all linear preference assignments over the multiple reward criteria at once. The algorithm can be viewed as an extension to standard reinforcement learning for MDPs where instead of repeatedly backing up maximal expected rewards, we back up the set of expected rewards that are maximal for some set of linear preferences (given by a weight vector, w→). We present the algorithm along with a proof of correctness showing that our solution gives the optimal policy for any linear preference function. The solution reduces to the standard value iteration algorithm for a specific weight vector, w →. Copyright 2008 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

abstract={As a multiple criteria decision making (MCMD) technique, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution(TOPSIS) traditionally has been applied in multiple criteria decision analysis. Based on D.Wu's data mining model, the TOPSIS model presented in this paper has improved from two aspects. Firstly, it extents to deal with both crisp and fuzzy data; Secondly, in order to really following automatic machine learning principles to the largest extent, the weights must be immune to the subjective element and the data noise. Here, the weights are obtained from data sets based on support vector regression(SVR), which is a more robust and efficient data regression method than the traditional data regression method. Thus the proposed model can provide additional efficient tool for comparative analysis of data sets. We apply it in supply chain complexity evaluation, and simulation is used to validate the proposed models.},

Similar to support vector machine (SVM) methodology, MSM training is formulated as a multicriteria optimization problem which aims at maximizing the separation margin and minimizing the empirical error rate on training data simultaneously. By making certain relaxation assumptions, MSM training can be reformulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem that can be solved efficiently by some standard optimization algorithms designed for SDP. Evaluation experiments are conducted on the task of the recognition of most confusable Kanji character pairs identified from popular Nakayosi and Kuchibue handwritten Japanese character databases. It is observed that the MSM-trained MP-based classifier achieves a similar character recognition accuracy as that of the state-of-the-art SVM-based classifier, yet requires much fewer classifier parameters. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of Feature Subset Selection - FSS - algorithms is to select a subset of features from the original set of features that describes a data set according to some importance criterion. To accomplish this task, FSS removes irrelevant and/or redundant features, as they may decrease data quality and reduce several of the desired properties of classifiers induced by supervised learning algorithms. As learning the best subset of features is an NP-hard problem, FSS algorithms generally use heuristics to select subsets. Therefore, it is important to empirically evaluate the performance of these algorithms. However, this evaluation needs to be multicriteria, i.e., it should take into account several properties. This work describes a simple model we have proposed to evaluate FSS algorithms which considers two properties, namely the predictive performance of the classifier induced using the subset of features selected by different FSS algorithms, as well as the reduction in the number of features. Another multicriteria performance evaluation model based on rankings, which makes it possible to consider any number of properties is also presented. The models are illustrated by their application to four well known FSS algorithms and two versions of a new FSS algorithm we have developed.

abstract={The objective of this paper is to present a systematic procedure to support environmental engineers during the evaluation of alternative options, identifying both, the strong and weak points of their decisions. The evaluation of alternative options in the design of environmental systems is complex because several objectives must be considered simultaneously (e.g. environmental, technical, economical, legal), i.e. the problem is multicriteria. The systematic procedure presented consists of three steps: 1) multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), where the best alternative is selected among the most promising options by evaluating the degree of accomplishment of several design objectives; 2) sensitivity analysis, where multidimensional response surfaces are generated to represent the variation of the selected option with respect to the relative importance of the design objectives; and 3) data analysis through the application of classification trees. The resulting set of rules highlights the relationship amongst the design objectives and the selected alternative without requiring a detailed examination of data values. The capability of this new procedure is demonstrated with a case study where the bioreactor of a wastewater treatment plant is designed to achieve simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal. The results demonstrate how this new procedure supports the systematic evaluation of alternative options during the conceptual design of environmental processes.},

abstract={The problem of rank aggregation has been studied in contexts varying from sports, to multi-criteria decision making, to machine learning, to academic citations, to ranking web pages, and to descriptive decision theory. Rank aggregation is the mapping of inputs that rank subsets of a set of objects into a consistent ranking that represents in some meaningful way the various inputs. In the ranking of sports competitors, or academic citations or ranking of web pages the inputs are in the form of pairwise comparisons. We present here a new paradigm using an optimization framework that addresses major shortcomings in current models of aggregate ranking. Ranking methods are often criticized for being subjective and ignoring some factors or emphasizing others. In the ranking scheme here subjective considerations can be easily incorporated while their contributions to the overall ranking are made explicit. The inverse equal paths problem is introduced here, and is shown to be tightly linked to the problem of aggregate ranking "optimally". This framework is useful in making an optimization framework available and by introducing specific performance measures for the quality of the aggregate ranking as per its deviations from the input rankings provided. Presented as inverse equal paths problem we devise for the aggregate ranking problem polynomial time combinatorial algorithms for convex penalty functions of the deviations; and show the NP-hardness of some forms of nonlinear penalty functions. Interestingly, the algorithmic setup of the problem is that of a network flow problem. We compare the equal paths scheme here to the eigenvector method, Google PageRank for ranking web sites, and the academic citation method for ranking academic papers. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The problem of group ranking, also known as rank aggregation, has been studied in contexts varying from sports, to multicriteria decision making, to machine learning, to ranking Web pages, and to behavioral issues. The dynamics of the group aggregation of individual decisions has been a subject of central importance in decision theory. We present here a new paradigm using an optimization framework that addresses major shortcomings that exist in current models of group ranking. Moreover, the framework provides a specific performance measure for the quality of the aggregate ranking as per its deviations from the individual decision-makers' rankings. The new model for the group-ranking problem presented here is based on rankings provided with intensity- that is, the degree of preference is quantified. The model allows for flexibility in decision protocols and can take into consideration imprecise beliefs, less than full confidence in some of the rankings, and differentiating between the expertise of the reviewers. Our approach relaxes frequently made assumptions of: certain beliefs in pairwise rankings; homogeneity implying equal expertise of all decision makers with respect to all evaluations; and full list requirement according to which each decision maker evaluates and ranks all objects. The option of preserving the ranks in certain subsets is also addressed in the model here. Significantly, our model is a natural extension and generalization of existing models, yet it is solvable in polynomial time. The group-rankings models are linked to network flow techniques. ©2006 INFORMS.},

abstract={The growing number of computer network attacks or intrusions has caused huge lost to companies, organizations, and governments during the last decade. Intrusion detection, which aims at identifying and predicting network attacks, is a fast developing area that has attracted attention from both industry and academia. Technologies have been developed to detect network intrusions using theories and methods from statistics, machine learning, soft computing, mathematics, and many other fields. We have previously proposed multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and multiple criteria nonlinear programming (MCNP) models for two-group intrusion detection. Although these models achieve good results in two-group classification problems, they perform poorly on multi-group situations. In order to solve the problem, we introduce the kernel concept into multiple criteria models in this paper. Experimental results show that the new model provides both high classification accuracies and low false alarm rates in three-group and four-group intrusion detection. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={The classification problem statement of multicriteria decision analysis is to model the classification of the alternatives/actions according to the decision maker's preferences. These models are based on outranking relations, utility functions or (linear) discriminant functions. Model parameters can be given explicitly or learnt from a preclassified set of alternatives/actions. In this paper we propose a novel approach, the Continuous Decision (CD) method, to learn parameters of a discriminant function, and we also introduce its extension, the Continuous Decision Tree (CDT) method, which describes the classification more accurately. The proposed methods are results of integration of Machine Learning methods in Decision Analysis. From a Machine Learning point of view, the CDT method can be considered as an extension of the C4.5 decision tree building algorithm that handles only numeric criteria but applies more complex tests in the inner nodes of the tree. For the sake of easier interpretation, the decision trees are transformed to rules. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Previous researches in feature selection often focus on choosing appropriate measurement to evaluate features. This seems to be good for structured data but rather difficult to text, a non-structured data. Our main contribution in this paper is to propose a new approach of feature selection based on multi-criteria ranking of features. A new model for feature selection is propose; based on a threshold value for each criterion, a new procedure for feature selection is proposed and applied to a text categorization. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms performances in compare to conventional feature selection methods.},

abstract={This paper concerns the design and development of an adaptive planner that is able to adjust its parameters to the characteristics of a given problem and to the priorities set by the user concerning plan length and planning time. This is accomplished through the implementation of the k nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm on top of a highly adjustable planner, called HAP. Learning data are produced by running HAP offline on several problems from multiple domains using all value combinations of its parameters. When the adaptive planner HAPNN is faced with a new problem, it locates the k nearest problems, using a set of measurable problem characteristics, retrieves the performance data for all parameter configurations on these problems and performs a multicriteria combination, with user-specified weights for plan length and planning time. Based on this combination, the configuration with the best performance is then used in order to solve the new problem. Comparative experiments with the statistically best static configurations of the planner show that HAPNN manages to adapt successfully to unseen problems, leading to an increased planning performance.},

abstract={In dynamic real-time control (RTC) of regional water systems, a multicriteria optimization problem has to be solved to determine the optimal control strategy. Nonlinear and/or dynamic programming based on simulation models can be used to find the solution, an approach being used in the Aquarius decision support system (DSS) developed in The Netherlands. However, the computation time required for complex models is often prohibitively long, and therefore such a model cannot be applied in RTC of water systems. In this study, Aquarius DSS is chosen as a reference model for building a controller using machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and reinforcement learning (RL), where RL is used to decrease the error of the ANN-based component. The model was tested with complex water systems in The Netherlands, and very good results were obtained. The general conclusion is that a controller, which has learned to replicate the optimal control strategy, can be used in RTC operations.},

abstract={We present a meta-learning method to support selection of candidate learning algorithms. It uses a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to identify the datasets that are most similar to the one at hand. The distance between datasets is assessed using a relatively small set of data characteristics, which was selected to represent properties that affect algorithm performance. The performance of the candidate algorithms on those datasets is used to generate a recommendation to the user in the form of a ranking. The performance is assessed using a multicriteria evaluation measure that takes not only accuracy, but also time into account. As it is not common in Machine Learning to work with rankings, we had to identify and adapt existing statistical techniques to devise an appropriate evaluation methodology. Using that methodology, we show that the meta-learning method presented leads to significantly better rankings than the baseline ranking method. The evaluation methodology is general and can be adapted to other ranking problems. Although here we have concerned on ranking classification algorithms, the meta-learning framework presented can provide assistance in the selection of combinations of methods or more complex problem solving strategies.},

During the last two decades several new approaches, such as mathematical programming, neural networks, machine learning, rough sets, multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA), etc., have been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional, statistical and econometric techniques that have dominated this field since the 1930s. This paper focuses on the MCDA approach. A new method to achieve multi-group discrimination based on an iterative binary segmentation procedure is proposed. Five real world applications from the field of finance (credit cards assessment, country risk evaluation, credit risk assessment, corporate acquisitions, business failure prediction) are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method as opposed to discriminant analysis. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={During the last two decades credit cards have became one of the main ways for accomplishing financial transactions. The number of credit card owners have increased rapidly. Unfortunately, at the same time the cases where the owners cannot fulfil their obligations to the banks have also been increased. This fact forced credit institutions and banks to search for methodologies that will allow them to accurately evaluate the credibility of each credit card applicant. Multi-criteria decision aid methods as well as machine learning algorithms can be used to accomplish this task. The present paper proposes a new intelligent decision support system for credit card evaluation, based on a machine-learning algorithm, namely the Composite Rule Induction System and the Rough Sets. The major advantage of the algorithm and the system is the incorporation of qualitative variables, which have an essential role in credit card evaluation. The system is applied on a real case study concerning credit card evaluation by a leading Greek commercial bank and the obtained results are compared to the results of multi-criteria decision aid methods as well as other machine learning algorithms. © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Operational monitoring of land cover from satellite data will require automated procedures for analyzing large volumes of data. We propose multiple criteria for assessing algorithms for this task. In addition to standard classification accuracy measures, we propose criteria to account for computational resources required by the algorithms, stability of the algorithms, and robustness to noise in the training data. We also propose that classification accuracy take account, through estimation of misclassification costs, of unequal consequences to the user depending on which cover types are confused. In this article, we apply these criteria to three variants of decision tree classifiers, a standard decision tree implemented in C5.0 and two techniques recently proposed in the machine learning literature known as "bagging" and "boosting." Each of these algorithms are applied to two data sets, a global land cover classification from 8 km AVHRR data and a Landsat Thematic Mapper scene in Peru. Results indicate comparable accuracy of the three variants of the decision tree algorithms on the two data sets, with boosting providing marginally higher accuracies. The bagging and boosting algorithms, however, are both substantially more stable and more robust to noise in the training data compared with the standard C5.0 decision tree. The bagging algorithm is most costly in terms of computational resources while the standard decision tree is least costly.

abstract={In industrial production processes, materials and different forms of energy are provided, converted, stored and transported. Environmental impacts can be identified at any stage of the energy and material flow process. Due to the fact that production units and processes are interconnected with energy and material flows, it is of special interest to develop production control mechanisms, which control the energy and material streams so that available resources are utilised most efficiently and reduce emissions and by-products caused by the production process. Methodical production control strategies can be based on optimal algorithms, production rules or methods of machine learning. Due to the complexity of real production systems, it is advisable to use heuristic approaches. In order to analyse the behaviour of different control strategies, the developed systems are verified by an exemplary production system from the textile industry, consisting of a dye house, a hydro-power, a boiler house, and a flue gas neutralisation facility. A verification of the developed systems shows that Fuzzy Expert Systems, Neural Networks, and Neuro-Fuzzy approaches can be applied for the controlling of energy and material flows, taking into account economic and emission orientated goals. The selection of a certain approach mainly depends on the structure of the available production knowledge. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper we present a case evidence generation architecture, CEG, that supports case based decision and knowledge modeling. CEG is a blackboard based system that supports case evidence generation and acquisition. It can be used to define case decision classes, to model case knowledge elements, to represent prototypical case features and cases, to index cases according to decision classes or prototypical case realizations and to model elements of bias or error in case representation. We place CEG in the context of multicriteria decision making and draw architectural components from Machine Learning. We give an overview of CEG and CEG knowledge components. We demonstrate CEG by means of two 'real world' decision making exemplars drawn from retail sales evaluation and medical decision making. Finally, we explore architectural properties and discuss the potential for further research on the subject. © 1995.},
